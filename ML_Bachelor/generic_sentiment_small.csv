positive,"We-Ko-Pa has been prominently listed as one of the places to play if you are in Arizona.  I first played it several years ago, and it has become one of my favorite desert courses in Arizona.   There are two courses - Cholla, and Saguaro, and although they are both desert courses, they are somewhat different. The cholla course is an older, more mature course and doesn't have the same feel as the Saguaro course.  The Saguaro course can be walked, but has a wild side to it and to me, seems to have more elevation changes. That said, both courses are immaculate, wonderful condition, and a joy to play.

Over the years, I have played the Saguaro course more, but lately the Cholla course has grown on me.  Now when my golfing buddies come down, I always make it a point to play both courses with them.  This has led to some interesting memories.  

The first time we played, despite my warnings, one of the players wandered off the Saguaro course and found a Jumping Cholla.  He liked it so much, he brought it back to us - stuck all down one side of his body.  It took us quite a while to get them off of him - and then he wanted us to give him extra strokes. Not a chance.

Another time, one of my friends teed off on a par 3 on the Cholla course, and hit it into a dry creek bed. He seemed to lose his composure, and hit five provisionals, which also went into the desert. Then he found his first ball, and ended up with a par!!  Of course, we haven't let him forget the five provisionals...

I have read some comments about the marshals on the course, and in the past would agree. However, the last two times we played, the marshals have been very good - very courteous and very helpful.  The last time, while we were playing cart path only, one of the players was very slow (as usual) and the female marshal most diplomatically asked us to speed up.  She was one of the nicest, most courteous marshals I have had experience with, and consequently, one of the most effective.

The courses have a nice driving range, chipping and sand area, and putting greens. Unfortunately, they no longer allow you to use them, unless you are playing one of the courses (you used to be able to pay a daily fee to use them).

Finally, the service is friendly and courteous - from the drop off, to the restaurant, to the desk personnel, I have had nothing but pleasant experiences with the employees.

I think any golfer should experience these courses at least once - a visit would be well worth it.",2

Stock ear-phones are awesome & provides crystal clear sound, enjoyed watching movies with earphones on. Phone works in dual VOLTE mode which means you can use your JIO+Airtel in parallel with any of the sim open for data. (ex: if your airtel data is activated, you can still use Jio sim to make/receive calls). Also separate slot for SIMs & SD card, which means you can upgrade to 256gb ROM & still get to use both SIMs (most current phones have common slot for Sim2 & SD). Fast charger does a good job, battery is decent & one whole day uses 80% max. Operation has been smooth so far, no delay or hang. All cameras did a good job. Though the price is not that aggressive, its not very cheap either. But attractive exchange price & No-cost EMI helps the buyer with dual advantage (got 6k for my 3 yrs old Lenovo K5 Note Vibe which I purchased for 11.5k three years back! .. now thats a deal).

Phone came with applied screen-guard & premium leather pouch. OPPO has ensured completeness in its offering leaving no room for the buyer to go to phone accessories shop!

I was originally planning for Oneplus 7, but bigger RAM & attractive offers floored me here.

The phone is definitely a True Value For money with great features.....
The mobile is definitely an eye-catcher due to its Premium finish, Slim body, Bezel less screen and the Double shaded back panel (I got a Gradation Blue Variant for me !)
The volume and power buttons are placed rightly and are easy to access.
Camers has 16 MP + 3 MP + 3MP Triple camera which captures Amazing shots !
With 7 different modes, you can choose the best one according to the scene being clicked. There's a button for Wide Angle which instantly widens the scene to be captured. I have attached the shots of the ceiling with and without Wide Angle Mode. Besides, the stickers and beauty modes work superb to get attractive selfie too.
6.4 inch Super AMOLED display is brilliant and a small U shaped notch adds to the attraction of its infinity display... The touch and interface is super smooth too and the brightness level is very efficient. You don't need to set it to full brightness when you are outside even in the afternoon.
With it's huge 4GB RAM and 64GB Storage, it's very easy to perform as many tasks as you want without any lag. The phone performs flawlessly without any lag or heating. You can activate Pop up window setting and it will make your Multi Tasking lot more easy and interesting too.
Battery sure is a huge one, i.e.5000mAh, but I didn't feel it sufficient enough to last for 24 hours even. Maybe, it's due to network issues or maybe I have to watch it again after some more charge..
The Face recognition works great !
Fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive.
The audio quality of the speaker and the earpiece is good.
Overall, I feel it is an Amazing phone in this price and I am very satisfied with it's overall performance. It completely justifies it's price. I would strongly recommend this device to everyone looking for a Superb mobile in a moderate budget. Go for it and Thank me later !",2

What!"" (if you can)

All those single bathroom stalls where the door doesn't become opaque unless you lock it all the way but I'm sure the ploy here is that as the night goes on and people get more and more drunk, girls will come in and maybe haphazardly lock the door but not all the way but they don't care because they have to pee so hard so they're sitting on the throne and watching people walk by and think that ""Ohmygodit'slikeaonewaymirrorthat'ssocool!"" but then they notice that guys are now just standing there and converging on the other side of the door looking right at them and all of a sudden the drunk girls realize that the door is not a one-way-mirror at all but.... - raise your hands up in the air and say ""What!

I can't emphasize how incredibly average and underwhelming the fare here is. See, I'm a burrito man, myself. I don't claim to know Mexican food or it's various subgenres, but I did live in San Diego for three years and I've definitely had what I would call over-the-top, blow your socks out your a** good Mexican food. The same can be said for any number of burritos. 

America's, I'm sorry to say it, but neither your tacos nor your burritos live up to the incredible hype that now surrounds you (although, the salsa was really, really good).

It's not that bad. But the food is righteous. The pre-meal bread with the tomato + balsamic + red onion deliciousness was such a great alternative to the typical bread and oil. We split the antipasti (yes, the portions are comically large... we maybe cleared a layer (a delicious, delicious layer) of very fresh, yummy artichoke hearts, prosciutto wrapped canteloupe, and a smattering of other favorites.

3. Mobile getting heat while using internet/camara /game to 15-20 mnts,  then why xiaomi inbuilt cooling technology. Dont know what is the use of that.
4. Display is not effected as much as expected.
5. Very irritating thing is finger prints easily stamping on back side of mobile. Thats huge problem looking very dirty.
6. Coming up to camara too much of bobble  from body, thats damage very quick. I think its very big essert this model.
7. Pouch is not fixing properly after installing tempered glass. So Should buy another pouch.
8. Glass, touch, design are good.
9. Performance quick responce.
10. Camara aaswam.

Given, there are a few star performers here who give it their all, bust their ass, and never forget a customer's name. And Sue, the owner, really seems to genuinely care about each and every person that walks in the door. But the service is so unwaveringly slow that I am often prevented from eating here due to time constraints. Example: I once ordered a cup of soup to go-- soup, mind you, that is completely ready and cooked, just sitting in a big tureen in the back-- and it took 35 minutes. 

So, yes, the food is amazingly fresh, inventive, delectable. The prosciutto is shipped in from Italy. The bread is natural and baked locally.

On top of it, is the 8MP (1/4"") snapper behind f/2.2 13mm lens for ultrawide-angle shots. And below the main snapper is the 2MP sensor behind an f/2.4 lens for capturing depth information when shooting in portrait mode.",2

I was torn between Samsung M30 S which was cheaper for Great Indian sale and Realme X2 on Flipkart. But Redmi note 8 pro had more good reviews. Got 10 % discount with credit card for 6gb ram / 128 gb storage.  Samsung has a plastic body vs. Redmi's gorilla glass front and back which looks premium, which was a deciding factor for me.
Camera also is better than Samsung. Has a good battery and 18 w fast charger. Display is vibrant. Touch and finger print scanner is quick without lags.

Finger print scanner is right below the camera lens on the back so your finger smudges lens if you are not used to it, if you have used front finger print scanner.
Not a big fan of MiUI coming from pure Android. Disabled all ads and bloatware before first use. MiUI has dark mode which is good.

Whenever I go there, I get slices. I also usually only spend about $6. To me, that's awesome when I'm craving some pizza pie. By the way, Mamma Mia serves good ol' fashoined NY-style pizza. Their toppings range from traditional (roni, sausage, veggies) to fancy (salmon, bleu cheese, capers). I have been known to order capers on my slices (and they were actually really good). Normally I ask for the slices well done, and I'd recommend you do the same if you like that extra bit of crispiness like me. The slices come out relatively quickly, and I've never been dissatisfied with what I've been given.

I've yet to try their sandwiches or pastas, but in time I'm sure I'll get around to it. At $6 or less a pop, I feel like I've got a good thing going. If I'm in the mood for pizza and I don't feel like traveling far or spending much, Mamma Mia is towards the top of my list.",2

Steamed veggies are not CHARBROILED asparagus... everything was so horrible.  We didn't complain, but we did ask about the charcoal that was our veggies....  Which we were given a crappy attitude in response.  We weren't even looking for it to be taken off our bill, just a recognition that the food was TOTALLY burned and half our orders were wrong. BTW there was no offer made either to fix anything...  in times like these SERVICE SERVICE SERVICE AND QUALITY / CONSISTENCY will get you through.   if you don't know what a good meal is and you want to think you're cool cause you hang out in a place that looks like it was furnished by IKEA, you should try it.

positive,"Below are the issues listed after 10 days of usage:

1. This is a performance phone absolutely no doubt about it but it isn't delivering the top notch performance, it takes around 2-3 seconds to load just after restart.

2. Caller picture is getting blurred. I tried with some third party apps also but the issue still exists with some caller. But when I set caller picture  for any contact with phone's default caller picture feature, I'm still getting blurred image when I call someone.

3. Sometimes (let's say 2 out of 10 times) when connected with Bluetooth headset the sound output flickers, when phone is locked. Works fine when phone is unlocked. However, it get resolved while I disconnect the device and reconnect.

4. Sometimes I feel heating issues with this phone (I'm not a PUBG guy, I don't play heavy games on phone). With normal usage, I feel heating issues. However, occurrence frequency of this issue is very low.

5. Sometimes I don't see music navigation layout when phone is locked. I have to restart the device, then able to see the navigation buttons on lock screen.

I'll reach out to One Plus service center and hope they'll resolve it.

Overall this is a good choice within 40k bracket,  AMOLED + 90Hz display is awesome. Camera in daylight is great. Haven't tested the supermicro shots. Nightmode picture quality lies between good to very good (very good excluded).

Thanks,
A satisfied One Plus user (If they resolve the above mentioned issues😃 )",2

Pros:
Battery is good
Cons:
Camera is not even 13 mgp.

Final Verdict : If you want to buy genuine products better go to FLIPKART. Samsung is making us fool by selling a 8mgp instead of 48mgp.",0
negative,"M30s has worst picture quality and a lag in other app operations.
Not a worthy phone which tells the camera is 48MP.
Pixels when u expand little, u will feel like it's 5MP old phone.
Pics in homelight and evening / night photos r even worse.
Spoke to Amazon customer care for 1hr and they even don't want to give me a higher value other company phone in return of this bad phone which will be beneficial for Amazon.
All the best for people who buy 48MP phones thinking that they will get crisp n better pixel photos. No. U will be dissatisfied.

After current service from Amazon, will shift to Flipcart even though I am a prime member. Anyway mistakes happen.

So next time anyone buys a phone, it will only be replaced with same phone if it's physical damaged and for other issues with phone u have to go to service centre. Learnings for me.

Samsung, photo quality is seen by clicking photos and seeing the quality, not by asking Blancco to do auto test and say it's passed if camera clicks the photo. Laughable. Grow up.",0

positive,"My husband & I are addicted to Cherryblossom's ramen. Mr. T is Japanese & I lived in Japan for @4 years, so take my word it's authentic.

The mix of foods is not so strange if you're familiar with restaurants in Japan. The ramen is Hakata style, made with a pork broth & may be heavy/oily for some people, so why not please everybody? Be sure to ask for ""Cha Shu Ramen"" to get a few more pieces of pork. (extra $)

The salads are also fantastic; warm lightly fried (10?)Shrimp on a fresh spring mix base with mango dressing,  Shanghai Duck salad, and the Chicken Caesar was perfect, not heavily dressed like some ""roadhouses."" 

Mr. T & our daughter loved the Eggplant in Miso Sauce, & even the California Roll was good.

It's said Japan took the best of each country's cuisine. So there are French pastries, German beer, Italian pasta, and Indian curries. Save the banana bread for dessert if you can, or get one of their pastries. I've never have enough room.

If you like good WHITE bread, buy one of the Pullman loaves on the table by the front door. My first extra 20 pounds in Japan came from the good bread! (No whole grain breads were available 30 years ago!)

I think it's too small for groups over six.

Maybe we'll see you there.

Added 11/18/07
I think that their menus are not all alike, so if  ramen isn't on the menu you receive, you can still order it. (It's posted in Japanese on the wall.) For the basic, ask for ""Hakata Ramen."" For extra pork, ask for ""Cha-shu-men"" or ""Cha-shu-ramen.""
Either way, there's really not much pork in it. That's why you need a delicious shrimp or duck salad.",2

neutral,"Overall a mixed bag, with some good surprises and bad. Bought it in Sep 2019, writing review in Nov 2019, after heavy usage.
1. Security features -
Pro- are way too good. It allows you to selectively give permission to apps to your phone's contact, media, etc.
Con - BUT, overtly security features hinders screenshot taking ability citing "" security policy"". So if you like a Google image, you can't save it as screenshot. If you need a news article to be saved, or image on website to be saved, it won't allow a screenshot. It severely hinders usage and limits internetknky to surfing, not saving something for future use, never encountered it in other smartphones used till date.

2. Camera - Smartphones are primarily bought for internet, apps  calls and camera.
Pro - Above average pictures overall.
Con-
Lighter shades - Camera is unable to capture picture in natural light, as it is. Rather it adds whitish layer to all pictures. So if you are taking a selfie from front or back camera, either ways you will be captured at least 2-3 shades lighter or fairer. If that is what you want, it can be considered a pro as well coz pictures appear good BUT if you want to capture nature, sun, plants, animals or yourself as you are, then it's a disappointment as it is all in 2-3 shades of white/bright/light, however you want to put it.
Out of focus and camera doesn't capture despite wherever you tap - Another MAJOR con is camera fails to focus many a times, thereby capturing blurred images. You try rebooting, reopening camera but still it is completely blurred, and you can't figure out the thing captured. Due to this lack of focus, many a times it doesn't even capture image despite whenever you tap since it is so out of focus, camera fails to click and capture, rendering it useless. You need other people to capture the moment and depend on them to share pictures with you, sad!

3. Battery life - 5/5. Works for 2 days or longer, provided you keep switching data on and off and keep background app usage to minimum.

4. Sound quality - loud and good. Much better than other phones used.

5. Storage- 44GB is a life saver. You can download numerous apps and don't worry about space.

6. Built quality and sturdiness - below average. Other phones when accidentally dropped from bed/couch/road did not shatter, nor developed a crack. This phone's screen got majorly cracked when slipped out of pocket on road. Which seems to be fine since road is hard concrete, but it developed another screen crack chipping off on the edge when dropped from bed in short distance  on tiled floor at home. If it gets dropped no matter how small the distance or smooth the floor, it will crack, always, despite a cover and temper glass! Never found this a problem with any other phones used till date. They drop but body and screen were secure. Probably because the screen of this phone is slightly protuded from the body of the phone, hence whenever it drops, the screen faces direct and most impact, thereby cracking and chipping it off along with body at the edges. Possibly a design flaw.

7. Performance - is great. You can run any no. Of apps and it won't hang or slow down as yet. Hopefully it will remain so despite age and usage. Edited - Performance has turned average. The phone shuts down and reboots on its own when battery reaches 16% mark or when Youtube songs are being played, the phone shuts down automatically even when sufficient battery is remaining.

8. Touchscreen - Faulty. Sometimes nothing happens when the screen is touched. You need to unlock it and you slide k  screen and nothing happens. You have to lock and unlock for touchscreen to work again.

9. Backspace button - while making notes, if one wishes to delete a line or two and you quickly press backspace on keypad a couple of times, it automatically goes into a frenzy deleting ALL your notes in 2 secs. Tapping doesn't stop it, you need to go out of app and come back only to remember what you had written and write again.

10. Zoom - since the screen is a bit protruded, if you handle the screen with one hand using thumb to scroll the news site, then the thumb + the flesh below your thumb on your palm act together kn the screen and it zooms the screen instead of scrolling. You need to use both hands, one to scroll, one to hold the phone or rest phone on something and use ONLY your thumb to scroll. Design flaw probably.",1

positive,"Needless to say, loved the battery life on this one. I'm surprised as to how I have more than 50% battery left at the end of my day even after a good amount of mobile data+GPS being used(that too, without the power saving). I noticed that the fingerprint scanner physically moves a little bit though I haven't read if it's an intended feature but it seems cool since I have zero problems with it. The ultra-wide camera is a great experience. The low light camera quality can be improved as compared to other mid range phones. But I cannot complain since Samsung gives us so much in this price segment. The waterdrop notch looks appealing, the SUPER AMOLED display is something to talk about and the humongous 6GB RAM adds to the pleasure! I would 10/10 recommend!",2

I must say I was hesitant because I went with my then fiance (now husband) for dinner one night just to check it out and I was not impressed with the food.  However my very large group was so well accomodated, I couldn't have asked for more.  I would hightly recommend getting the hors d'oeurves packages that they offer.  A great price and something for everyone, they can get a plate and munch at bar tops with drinks while talking to everyone.  It was like having a bar with drinks and food just for my wedding party and family.  A truly great experience and I look forward to using this restaurant in the future for any event that requires a great atmosphere with great food and great service, for a large party.",2

The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!

I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.

The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks!

negative,"Don't know where I should start. Grand opening was on September 17th, 2010. We went to try this new Dim Sum place at the Mekong Plaza as they heavily advertised in the chinese newspapers and were advertising 30% off.

When I got there, the biggest eyesore is that they tried to make their portion of the Food Court as a regular ""Chinese"" restaurant. So imagine the picture of chandeliers hanging in the middle of a food court in the mall. It just looks too tacky, I thought they should've went with a more fast food type Dim sum like they have in San Gabriel, California.

Upon checking in with the hostess, they don't even issue numbers, they only call you by name. So that was already pretty different from how usual chinese restaurant run things. Totally not efficient at all.

Once we finally got a seat, things got worse.

Our ""Har Gow""/Shrimp dumpling was raw! The skin was thick and clumpy, the shrimp was severely undercooked. We asked them to exchange for another one, and it was still raw. We also had to exchange the shrimp egg roll as it was also raw. Their excuse was that they were too busy and did not have time to fully cook the food. Ok.....so how are the other 100s of asian restaurants able to serve dim sum at a fast pace with fully cooked food? That was probably the lamest excuse.

The trademark ""beef internal organs"" that I always love to order was pathetic. They charged the large price for a tiny little bowl, there were only a few tendons and mostly filled with Daikon. 

The BBQ Pork bun, another staple of Dim sum, was not that great either. There was barely any char siu in the bun, and the exterior of the bun was not fully cooked.

I understand that it is their first operating weekend, but the idea of a nice chinese dimsum place at a food court just doesn't fly in my opinion. They even offer wedding banquets here too. 

I don't think I'll be returning here unless they really upgrade the quality of the food. The idea is definitely novel, but will be a hard sell.",0

I would drive around the city, looking at all the strip malls and low-end manicure chop shops and wonder, ""Where the hell do people go grocery shopping?"" And while Trader Joe's is GREAT, I'd be hard-pressed to do all of my shopping there.

So thank God for Safeway, right? Although Safeway is generally a little more expensive than other grocery stores, you can pretty much get anything you need there. This particular location was so clean it was beaming! Or was that just me?

It had everything you'd expect from a Safeway--from a lovely floral department to a mini-Starbucks to a sizeable deli counter.

This phone has everything that one can ask for , be it good camera, battery, display, processor, be it anything, Samsung M30 fulfills your demand. Personally for me , I am highly impressed with its Battery power, it has 5000mah battery which is amazing. Now a days it is very difficult to get such a great battery life in a phone. It has 4gb RAM , which is one of best feature of this phone as myself being a game addict , i always wished for a phone in which i can enjoy playing games smoothly without lacking and Samsung M30 has made it possible. It has 3 cameras at the Back and one front camera as well which is pretty amazing. It's Infinity U display steals everything, it gives a premium feeling while using the phone. Samsung M30 is the best phone one can ask for. The design of the phone is amazing and I might not switch to some another phone for atleast sometime now.",2

I hope Samsung has to work on basic feature first, then work on secondary applications / feature. Even after talking to customer care,  they are unable to solve it. Seems like they are not in focus for customer. Anyway I have to thing for some other brand.",0

1.. It doesn't support OK Google voice command. You can use Google assistant by long pressing centre button but not by voice command.
2. Inconsistent WiFi connection. It get disconnected automatically after sometime.
3. Battery drainage. It has same battery as Redmi note 6 pro. But battery lasts much lesser than that.

We were met by a very friendly and helpful server who took great care of us the entire evening.  We started out with a wonderful wine recommended by our server, she let us taste 3 kinds before we chose what suited us.  We went on to enjoy the savory spinach and artichoke dip as well as fresh baked bread served with some olives and olive oil.  The caeser salad was a very large portion almost could have been my entree and the dressing was so fresh and light.  The croutons crisp and fresh baked.  We all ordered the hawaiian ribeye, OMG!! So moist and so juicy - the flavor was so fabulous and I could only eat half of it.  The loaded baked potato was also wonderful and very large.  I ended up taking half my meal home and was really happy that they let us sit quite awhile to chat with our friends after our meal was over (we were way too full for dessert however the server brought us a complimentary slice of key lime pie which my husband and friends said were fabulous I just was too full to try it) we never were rushed out and they kept refilling our drinks I can't wait to go back.  Was always a fan of Houston's in NYC and this was very much the same and enjoyed the jazzy low music in the background and the dim lighting that was warm and relaxing.",2

I get 60 fps at highest speed anyone could ever imagine..the best smartphone in the market.The camera has too many modes including portrait,,panorama, night mode & pro modes respectively..

(1) No SD Card Slot, 64 GB space is enough, but when you click photos, it upload to your google drive as back is ON.  If you Off the backup then 64 GB space will be minuscule.  Secondly when you download the photos the quality slightly downs and if you in a area where internet is not working or slow working, you would not be able to download your photos.  If there is SD Card then no need for such activities.  SD Card slot missing causing a lot of problem.
(2)  3.5mm jack is missing, for this they provide C-type connector through which you can insert you jack.  But for this you always have to carry it.

positive,"The Redmi Note series has always set the bar when it comes to the mid-range smartphone territory.
And once again, as an overall package, the Redmi Note 8 Pro is competing in flagship level territory, especially when it comes to the specs.

*Design - 5/5*
The glass sandwich design makes the phone feel elegant and subtle unlike the tacky metal Redmi Notes of old. The Note 8 Pro has a sturdy heft in hand and doesn't feel very unbalanced in weight distribution. One handed usage is not exceptional, since it is a pretty big phone. The camera lens array looks well designed on the back and the White Colour variant looks really good. My pick would be the Gamma Green variant however, it really is something else. Buttons are a non-issue, and I particularly like this placement over Samsung's way. I do not see the need for the text ""64MP AI Super Camera"" on the back however, but it is barely visible. The included case is very good quality and a boon to have.

*Display - 4/5*
The LCD is display is vibrant and bright and does not suffer from the dullness issues that used to plague Xiaomi phones in the past. The screen is terrific for everyday usage as well as Media Consumption. My only gripe would be that it still pales in front of the AMOLED display on the Realme XT which has much more vibrant colours and battery efficiency.

*Performance & Specs - 5/5*
There are really no complaints when it comes to specs. 6gb of RAM at this price point is simply a godsend and the USB-C port means this phone is 2019-ready. The Mediatek G90T SoC is a good performer in most day to day tasks and can handle heavy games at acceptable frame rates if you drop the settings down. It might be a bit worse than Qualcomm when it comes to open source work however, such as GCam ports and Custom OS's. The Haptic Motor is predictably bad.

*Battery - 5/5*
The 4500 mah battery eeks out almost 7 hours of Screen on Time on standard usage. Add to that the included fast charger in the box and this competes in flagship territory.

*Camera - 4/5*
The camera array here is definitely the best out there in this price point. It is insane how these mid-range smartphones can have a quad camera array while Google is still struggling to include two. The key difference between more competent camera phones and this however, is consistency.
While shots in the day time generally look excellent with good amount of detail, the Note 8 Pro often produces excessive noise in darker areas of the shot such as the highlights. Once the available light starts to go down, the more noise it produces in shots with the back camera - such as in the sky and in leaves of trees. But these shots are mostly - perfectly usable for social media.
What rectifies some of these issues is the Night Mode. Once Night Mode is used, the photos are generally more detailed and have much less noise.
Portrait Mode is generally very good.
The Telephoto lens works well, but the Ultrawide struggles to find focus and produces soft, sometimes hazy images. It is a tough angle to get right.
The Selfie Camera is very good. Switching off beauty mode works as expected and it shows good detail in human subjects. Skin tones are also fairly accurate and not too white.
There are a billion modes and the whole Camera UI can seem a bit overwhelming with the amount of features it has, some very stupid ones to boot. Video quality is good and the slow mo features are very nice to have. Super Slow Mo is very difficult to get right though and was a chore to time properly. Xiaomi loses some points for this cluttered Camera Application that has pretty lame stuff like filters, which you can anyways apply later within an editor before posting.

*Software - 3/5*
The Achilles heel of the Redmi Line - MIUI. There is a lot of bloatware that gets preinstalled onto the phone, which thankfully, can be uninstalled. MIUI has ads all over the place - please go through the setup process carefully and disable the user experience program to get rid of some of the ads. There is an article by Android Authority that can help you get rid of all the ads in MIUI, but it would be nice if we didn't have to deal with this in the first place.
No App Drawer, everything plopped onto the home screen in typical Apple Fashion. I was not a fan of this and installed Nova Launcher at the first opportunity, which worked without a hitch.
There are microstutters and jitters and lags occasionally across MIUI, not so much once Nova launcher has something to say about it.
The Settings Menu is confusing and suffers from poor translation. It lacks polish and the options are often poorly organized and overwhelming. While MIUI is chock full of features, it is slow to get updates and probably won't receive any more updates after Android 10.  The Gesture Navigation right now is not upto par with Android 10 fluidity and polish. If you buy this, you can't really be thinking along the lines of frequent updates and bug fixes.
Also, I could not get the Haptic feedback to work on GBoard, which is the default keyboard. This seems like a bug and is not nice to experience Day 1.

To Conclude - All the negatives listed are honestly nitpicking at what is a very good device at this price point. Xiaomi has indeed redefined what 15k brings you these days in Smartphone market. Suffice it to say that this is the Apple iPhone for people who still have two healthy, intact kidneys.",2

The last time we were at Brio was in September to celebrate our 16th Anniversary...yes consecutive years, and it was a great evening!  Last night, no so much.  In all the years we've been going to Brio, we have NEVER had such HORRIBLE service....ever!
The food was as amazing as it always is, but the terrible service completely overshadowed the tasty treats from the kitchen.  Our server stood and waited for us to finish sitting and before we could even open our napkins was asking for our drink order, not a good sign of things to come.  So I opted for water to come while we contemplated our cocktails.  So the water came, then nothing....nothing....no one....nada.  After about 10 minutes the server returned for our cocktail order.  The longest 10 minutes in history I'll admit.  So off to get the drinks....15 minutes later they arrived with the bread for the table...now mind you we'd been sitting alone at the table with no attention for 25 minutes now.  That is a lifetime for a restaurant that makes their money by turning tables.  When the drinks and bread arrived we opted to put in our dinner order, thinking we'd be in for a long bumpy night.  So we ordered, I ordered the Campanelle Carbonara, but with the Spicy Pepper Sauce from the Spicy Shrimp and Eggplant Appetizer, as opposed to the traditional sauce.  The server said no problem, you want the Angel Hair Pasta with the Spicy Sauce, do you want to add Shrimp or Chicken???  Well the Campanelle Carbonara comes with Chicken, Spinach, Bacon, and Parmesan Cheese.  So I explained it is NOT Angel hair Pasta as the Campanelle is a 'trumpet' shaped pasta with curled edges.  He said ""Oh you want the Lasagna Noodles"".....!  Of course I just said ask the chef to prepare the entree as he usually would, BUT, substitute the sauces.  Glenn ordered the same, but with the traditional sauce.  We both opted for the wedge salad, and asked that our entrees not be fired until we were completed with our salad.  After all, we all know all the ingredients are pre-made, and just needed to be assembled and heated..  Whew...I felt...that was exhausting!  Then the salads arrived.  Ice cold, yummy...!  Now we are back on track.  Boy that salad does hit all the notes that take you back to your childhood.  Nothing is better than Ice Cold Iceberg Lettuce w/blue cheese dressing, bacon crumbles, and fresh shaved Parmesan cheese!!!  
Then it happened.....yes just as we thought, in order to speed up the process that started so slowly............our entrees arrive BEFORE we were even 1/2 way through our salads.  So there they sit...all beautiful, completed just as ordered...and no Lasagna Noodles, no Angel Hair Pasta...just the wonderfulness awaiting our forks.  But...yes...But, we'd not finished our salads.  By the time we did, our pasta was sad, cold, and looked like it had let us down.  It didn't, OUR SERVER DID....oh by the way were we EVER asked if we wanted anything else to drink???  You guessed it NO....were we EVER asked how our dinner was???  You guessed it NO... Now you're probably saying, 'why didn't you do something about it'?  We'd have loved to, but there was no one around...not even someone to fill our water glasses.  Only after we were finished with our sad, cold, entrees and had stacked all the dirty dishes in a pile on the edge of the table, did our server make an appearance to ask how our dinner is going??? Are you kidding me???  We just asked for the check.  Upon his return we presented him with the discount that Brio had sent us for being frequent diners, he took that and never returned.  After sitting there at an empty table, empty water glasses and nothing to look at but the crumbs left behind from the wonderful flat bread.  We placed cash on the table and left to try to reclaim our evening.  On the way out, Glenn finally spotted a manager and explained our evening and that it would be a VERY LONG time before we tried Brio again.  He, the manager, just stumbled over his words and said he wished he's known about our evening so he could have done something about it.  Well maybe if he'd been circulating on the floor as opposed to hanging out with the ever so cute hostess' he'd have known.  Do we still like Brio...YES...are we extremely disappointed with our service last night...YES.....",1

I bought it because I wanted a notch less and fully bazelless phone so I am happy with it though it slightly big.

1. You can save 20 thousand rupees for same features.
2. Size of the phone is more suitable and handy. OnePlus 7 pro has awkward and uncomfortable size.
3. Its too heavy your wrist starts to fall when continuous usage.
4.Pop up camera seems good but not reliable for long run.
5. Warp charging is just a hype It takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.

Some good things because of them I bought it.
1. Best display with 90 Hz frame rate.

neutral,"Overall a mixed bag, with some good surprises and bad. Bought it in Sep 2019, writing review in Nov 2019, after heavy usage.
1. Security features -
Pro- are way too good. It allows you to selectively give permission to apps to your phone's contact, media, etc.
Con - BUT, overtly security features hinders screenshot taking ability citing "" security policy"". So if you like a Google image, you can't save it as screenshot. If you need a news article to be saved, or image on website to be saved, it won't allow a screenshot. It severely hinders usage and limits internetknky to surfing, not saving something for future use, never encountered it in other smartphones used till date.

2. Camera - Smartphones are primarily bought for internet, apps  calls and camera.
Pro - Above average pictures overall.
Con-
Lighter shades - Camera is unable to capture picture in natural light, as it is. Rather it adds whitish layer to all pictures. So if you are taking a selfie from front or back camera, either ways you will be captured at least 2-3 shades lighter or fairer. If that is what you want, it can be considered a pro as well coz pictures appear good BUT if you want to capture nature, sun, plants, animals or yourself as you are, then it's a disappointment as it is all in 2-3 shades of white/bright/light, however you want to put it.
Out of focus and camera doesn't capture despite wherever you tap - Another MAJOR con is camera fails to focus many a times, thereby capturing blurred images. You try rebooting, reopening camera but still it is completely blurred, and you can't figure out the thing captured. Due to this lack of focus, many a times it doesn't even capture image despite whenever you tap since it is so out of focus, camera fails to click and capture, rendering it useless. You need other people to capture the moment and depend on them to share pictures with you, sad!

3. Battery life - 5/5. Works for 2 days or longer, provided you keep switching data on and off and keep background app usage to minimum.

4. Sound quality - loud and good. Much better than other phones used.

5. Storage- 44GB is a life saver. You can download numerous apps and don't worry about space.

6. Built quality and sturdiness - below average. Other phones when accidentally dropped from bed/couch/road did not shatter, nor developed a crack. This phone's screen got majorly cracked when slipped out of pocket on road. Which seems to be fine since road is hard concrete, but it developed another screen crack chipping off on the edge when dropped from bed in short distance  on tiled floor at home. If it gets dropped no matter how small the distance or smooth the floor, it will crack, always, despite a cover and temper glass! Never found this a problem with any other phones used till date. They drop but body and screen were secure. Probably because the screen of this phone is slightly protuded from the body of the phone, hence whenever it drops, the screen faces direct and most impact, thereby cracking and chipping it off along with body at the edges. Possibly a design flaw.

7. Performance - is great. You can run any no. Of apps and it won't hang or slow down as yet. Hopefully it will remain so despite age and usage. Edited - Performance has turned average. The phone shuts down and reboots on its own when battery reaches 16% mark or when Youtube songs are being played, the phone shuts down automatically even when sufficient battery is remaining.

8. Touchscreen - Faulty. Sometimes nothing happens when the screen is touched. You need to unlock it and you slide k  screen and nothing happens. You have to lock and unlock for touchscreen to work again.

9. Backspace button - while making notes, if one wishes to delete a line or two and you quickly press backspace on keypad a couple of times, it automatically goes into a frenzy deleting ALL your notes in 2 secs. Tapping doesn't stop it, you need to go out of app and come back only to remember what you had written and write again.

10. Zoom - since the screen is a bit protruded, if you handle the screen with one hand using thumb to scroll the news site, then the thumb + the flesh below your thumb on your palm act together kn the screen and it zooms the screen instead of scrolling. You need to use both hands, one to scroll, one to hold the phone or rest phone on something and use ONLY your thumb to scroll. Design flaw probably.",1

negative,"I've known my way around Sky Harbor Airport since I was 4 years old and Terminal 1 was an actual terminal. In the time since then, their attempts to improve the airport, transportation and parking, and terminals have made it extremely confusing. Get in the wrong lane and you'll end up in the parking garage, when all you wanted was to drop off someone at the Departures curb. 

Terminal 2 remains the most accessible, with a parking lot located across the street and few airlines stationed there. Because only a couple airlines now use this terminal, security is a breeze. However, it's the oldest terminal, smells bad (like rotten pizza) and doesn't appear clean. 

Terminal 3 a little more of a hassle, although they have a parking garage attached to the terminal allowing you to enter any level through the elevator. More airlines use this terminal and it's much smaller than Terminal 4, making it easier to navigate.

Oh, Terminal 4. You're so nice, new and clean. You have access to great restaurants like Flo's Shanghai Cafe, Einstein's, Quizno's and more. I love Taberna del Tequila for a drink just prior to my flight inside security access (I don't like to fly, I prefer a bloody mary prior to boarding). You have tons of shops from Borders Books to local AZ tourist junk. I would like to love you, but you are just a mess. It's way to difficult to navigate your lanes to get where you're going, pick up and drop off is dangerous due to the people who pull away from the curb into lanes without looking, and security is painful- not only is there always a LONG line, but TSA agents regularly yell at people to ""pay attention!"" I dread flying out of Terminal 4 because I have to leave extra early for all the BS.

There are much easier airports to navigate and use, but we're stuck with Sky Harbor. I can only hope the light rail access once complete will help in making it a more user friendly airport.",0

positive,"was i ever lucky to pick dr. karawi from a random list of doctors near my home from my insurance website.

ever since i was a kid, i barely remember seeing my dentist. his hygienist came in, cleaned my teeth, then the dentist came in with his long nose hairs and big belly and bald head and stinky breath and started shoving sharp metal objects into my teeth. then he left, saying only ""hmmph"". he had a beach house in the cayman islands.

dr karawi is exactly opposite of that (don't know if he has a house in the caymans though). what really, really, really surprised me was the karawi cleaned my teeth....the Dentist! he does that for all his patients. i asked him why, and he just said he likes to get to know his patients. how novel!

he is extremely friendly and likeable but always professional. he will joke and talk to you about your vacations, plans for the weekend, etc, but then always keeps it serious when discussing your dental care. i sincerely appreciate his services and friendliness. we liked him so much, even invited him to our house warming party!

so for excellent dental care and outgoing service, Dr. Karawi is your man.

Like literally I couldn't finish the game at all. Now I'm no expert, but one thing is certainly obvious that OnePlus 7t is a device which should be able to withstand high graphic games in extreme modes. However, I doubt if it could have been a software problem from the game itself unable to run smoothly on my device or was it my phone's problem? I don't know...all things considered #PUBG works Great on my phone even in extreme graphic OnePlus 7t can pull it off without a sweat. But I gotta tell you though your hands are gonna sweat it out.😜
#Fingerprint Scanner.
It's okay and not so fast as those dedicated finger prints sensors I'd say, but sometimes it failed to recognize my own finger prints!! So I'd give it 6 out of 10. And I've got my reasons for rating it that way and it's pretty convenient if I'd explain why, besides it's much easier to understand practically.😅

negative,"Was happy with this phone just for the first two to three days. But when I started using it i see that there are many UI issues. Especially, the ok google does not work, bulk photo sharing from whatsapp to an email or google drive not possible etc. Another key issue is the frequent drop of data connection due to which regular refresh of data connection is required. The MI community is not at all helpful. The customer support guys not at all knowledgeable. I spoke to two people about the ok google issue...but none of them knew what to do about Ok google.",0
negative,"Writting this review after using 6 days.
Cons:
1. Over heating during normal use, even not installed any game or heavy applications.
2. Often screen getting minimised, while using applications.
3. Front camera average
4. Slowness while switching or opening application

 Pros:
1. Battery and charging good
2. Screen display good
3. Sound quality ok.

positive,"I'm in love. The festive décor charmed me the second I walked in the door. We sat down and were immediately greeting by a sweet waitress carrying a basket of chips. The chips were light and fresh and came with two salsas, a red and a green avocado salsa.

We ordered: Camarones aguachile hot drowned shrimp, Camarones culichi shrimps in a green sauce,tomatill & cilantro, rezongue enchiladas crab enchiladas in a red sauce. I also ordered a club soda and when the waitress asked if I wanted it prepared mexi style I said yes. What she brought back was a delicious mix of club soda, salt and muddled lime. It's my new favorite drink. 

We patiently waited for our meal and remarked on the little mermaid scene in front of us. I almost expected the crustaceans to come to life and start playing music.  Then to our surprise little fish tostadas were dropped on our table. What a nice touch!
The dishes were excellent, all were paired with homemade tortillas, beans and white rice with vegetables.  The camarones culichi was my favorite.

Fresh seafood, fun atmosphere, great service.",2

negative,"Great food can be found anywhere. Great service is one in a million these days. This place gets an A+ in the most awful service I have ever received and if you have/had a Groupon for this place like I did, don't even bother going. You'll be treated worse than a bothersome fly on a hot and humid day.

It's simple. Businesses put  their name out by working with daily coupon sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, etc., to garner new and potential repeat customers. Instead, after going there with my handy coupon, I can't help but drive by this place on the way home and think nothing but the horrible experience I received. 

I went with my boyfriend and bought the Groupon because I was impressed due to online reviews and decided to splurge on a good ole' prime rib. We sit down, am impressed with the old school decor, and then the server from Azkaban appears. We tell her that we'd like to order off the special evening menu where it's a little cheaper and tell her joyfully that we found this place through Groupon and that it's our first time. Wrong thing to do. I don't know if it's because past Groupon-ers don't tip well or something, but I could swear her smile immediately turned 180 degrees in an instant. 

It took our food (the chicken and prime rib) almost 33 minutes to come out. All we did was nom ... and nom ... and nom on the watery coleslaw and gritty liver (which isn't to blame since I was never a liver fan). Not once did our server come by our table. We watched her run into the kitchen and either not come back out for a while or attend to other tables. It was another server that came out and gave us our food so we let our frustration go since it wasn't her fault and there's no use in calling her out for nothing. We asked if she knew where our server was, and she said she would look for her. 10 minutes later, nothing, yet it was the new server who kept coming back, asking if everything was alright like a normal server should. 

Then it was time for the check and we just wanted to get out of there since we were basically ignored. 17 minutes pass, no check came even though our  table had been cleared. Our server was still MIA so we asked a random server to give us our check. He said he would tell our server to bring it back and we told him straight up that we didn't even want to see her face so another random server brought it back.

We had a table of 4 sitting next to us who even leaned over and asked us why we were being so calm when our non-existent server was treating us like crap. We didn't even want to bother waiting another 20 minutes just to talk to a manager since apparently the only way the servers here communicate is by playing Telephone so we just left after paying. The table beside us told us that they were going to complain for us since we wanted to leave, but whether they did or not I didn't even care at that point. 

To be honest, I can't even remember what the food tasted like, which isn't quite fair in a review. I went here a couple of months ago, but I have never had an experience where service overrode the taste of food. I'm pretty sure prisoners in a cafeteria get more attention than I did.

Maybe it wasn't even the Groupon. Who knows. All I know is that we ran out of there like Usain Bolt and tell anyone who asks about our worst dining experience that this is the place to experience it.",0

My local lady friend brought over a bottle of wine but forgot a corkscrew. No big deal, I thought to myself, as the front desk of a hotel will surely have a corkscrew. Nope. Coors Light it is.

The towels felt like they were made of cow tongue, and they missed our wakeup call one morning making me late for a training class that had cost me about $500.

negative,"I always hate giving bad reviews, but our service left quite a bit to be desired. I can normally dismiss such things, but it became evident that our bad service was not a fluke.

We arrived around 10:00 and was told that food would only be served until 11. That wouldn't be a problem at all except that our waitress didn't return with menus until close to 10:30 and then returned to take our orders at only a few minutes before 11. The place had other patrons, but it certainly wasn't so busy as to take an hour to get our orders. Unfortunately, on each of our visits, the waitress was half listening and seemed easily confused

The food itself was quite good. The Shepherd's pie was hot and tasty and the bloody marys were actually perfectly spiced. Neither was worth getting excited about, but they were certainly decent and reasonably priced. 

Considerably later in the evening, our waitress returned with the bill. There was one extra drink on the bill which no one ordered and she was perfectly friendly about saying she'd remove it, but we spent a good five minutes as she kept getting confused about our - apparently - very complicated instructions of ""$20 on the credit card. The rest in cash"" She continually read back excessively complex scenarios, and we kept asking her simply to put twenty on the card, that's all.

When she returned, she had taken $20 of our cash towards the bill, charged $60 to the card and kept the remaining $55 in cash as a tip. That's just shy of a 75% tip she assigned herself. 

We spoke to the manager, who couldn't find her for some time, and when she showed up, she blamed us repeatedly. She finally refunded the card and brought us our new bill, with the extra drink.

It wasn't worth arguing about at that point.

The sad part is that everyone at my table, and our surrounding tables started telling similar tales from past visits. I guess this kind of service is not uncommon.",0

No calls attended, no gaming, used data for just updating apps and installation. I would say my usage is below average and still i am facing this issue. Even I do have redmi note 7 pro bought from flipkart and it's been 1 year and the performance and battery backup is better than this. Watching cricket on hotstar, took 5 calls for 2, 3 hrs long and still it has 65% battery. I am sure this is a defective product and customer care doesn't care ....I called them 3 times and they told me to perform battery calibration test I did that and already factory data rest and clear the caches still it is draining way too fast. They have provided me a defective piece and not letting me return or replace. On asking they told me that they have to follow procedure and will send technician and he will not be available till 27. I asked them to speak to their supervisor and as expected I was told that all the seniors are busy right now. Very dissappointed with amazon. I need my refund.",0

If u want phone only to see ads buy redmi 2 days for regular use. ..

If you want real smartphone experience in 10k budget it's the best phone..

Don't fall for YouTube and net reviews of Chinese phone.. Most of them are paid.. Xiomi has system and full page ads. Huawei is banned by USA. Vio / OPPO / realme hv same parent company, which fools customers. Reviewers strategically omit these point or mentioned them as minor points. .

 I have two phones in my home.. Samsung J7 prime and honor 6x. Both released with Android 6, had same pricing and same drop in price after 1 yr. But j7 prime got 2 os upgrade and regular security updates. The ui became more smooth and still working best. 6X became lagy. Honor promised 2 os upgrades but gave only one. There were delayed security updates.

So if want to see full page & system ads, compromise security, get bad calling experience, buy Chinese phones.. Otherwise there are much better options..

negative,"I just finished my G & S meal that I ordered to-go; actually, I just finished throwing it out. It was HORRIBLE. And by horrible, I mean shamefully bad. And by shamefully bad, I mean, heinous! I had a very disappointing experience here about a year ago but I thought I would give it another try. I should have proceeded with caution when I asked the long-term employees at the neighboring Blockbuster what was good and to the person, they all stammered and failed to reply. Seriously, zero out of four could give me one ""great"" dish! I've lived in both Mpls & Chicago and my Ex used to travel the Orient and we were always surprised at how POOR the quality of Asian food was in this area and WHY the people here, seemed to like it!? It's absolutely baffling!
I had the Orange Beef & Spring Rolls. The Orange Beef looked scarey right in the container. But when i ate it - UGH! The texture was all off and the sauce..... it had these big, clear, GELATINOUS, ..... ugh ugh ugh! I can't even talk about it. Like biting into a ball of corn-starchy orange extract! I'm still sick from those few bites! [Truly.] And while I ordered vegetable spring rolls, I got what tasted like low-quality hamburger meat! In fact I finally identified the flavor and texture as: SAUSAGE! It was like an Asian Spring Roll with chunks of Italian Sausage inside!! How's that for a combo? Ugh...... [stomach turning]
I'm sorry, I'm a Single Parent and I'm usually grateful to have someone cook for me. Grateful even when i am paying. But during ""tough times"" when i actually ""treat"" myself and then plunk down $20(!!) for unedible... yuck - it's totally, TOTALLY unacceptable!

The food was tasty, but not original. We ordered the ceviche app (which we liked the best), the mushroom tacos and the house salad with shrimp. Although our waitress came back and informed us that they were out of shrimp so we opted to try it without as there aren't too many non-meat or fish options on the menu. The smashed plantains and pumpkin seeds were a nice touch in the salad, but it was lacking something special.

As good as you can get here in Arizona;  it aint L.A or San Fran, but does a good job to satisfy the craving for real chinese.
 
Of all the Cofco asian restaurants, this is one of the more presentable ones to bring business clients or a new date, if ambiance is key to scoring positive brownie points.    
 
For some bizarre reason, on the weekends, it is filled with asian-women/white guy couples,    which strikes me as hilarious.  If it wasn't for this,  I would eat there multiple times a week. 
Asian woman orders from real chinese menu;  her white guy orders from chow mein menu.
 
Side note:  Get a grip; asian women check each other out, and  usually not in a nice way--like in a sizing you up-comparing you to herself way--so I usually end up losing my appetite when I catch one of them staring at me (and my man) and whispering to her white guy or her girlfriends about me;  yah, I understand the shit you say about me, asian girls, because I speak your language too, hello!
 
So I compensate for my chinese food cravings by quick carry out.  Works like a charm every time.  I'm happy, my own Cracker is happy.  Owner gets lots of business and is happy.

negative,"I stayed here last month. It's your average motel (since the doors face outside, not a hallway), and the breakfast buffet is okay (scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, bacon, cereal, batter to make waffles,   and toast provided). The walls are REALLY thin, so thin that the guy snoring next door kept us awake all night. 

The room was clean and equipped with a mini fridge (like the kind you'd keep in your dorm room) and microwave, although lacking a safety deposit box. If you want to keep your items safe, you have to bring your items to the front desk, make a list of what you're dropping off, and then sign. I was uncomfortable making a list, so I decided to forgo this process.

FYI if you call the front desk to order you a taxi, they actually order a car service. The car is an unmarked, dark-colored Lincoln sedan. To go to the 16th Street Sports Bar down the street cost us about $10 vs $6 for an actual taxi (which we ended up taking later). We didn't want to drink and drive, so not bad, but just know that the hotels in the area do not order taxis.

My main complaint is that we didn't have housekeeping service the entire time, hence the two stars. We left for lunch from 10:30AM - 1:30PM, returned, but housekeeping never arrived. We left again at 3PM for the rest of the day, and housekeeping, upon arrival back at the room after midnight, hadn't come. I called the front desk for someone to bring towels, but since there was no one to cover the front desk, we had to go get the towels ourselves. I also wanted an extra pillow, but the front desk person couldn't leave the front desk to get a pillow out of the housekeeping room. I thought this was very strange.

I guess for less than $100/night (Hilton resort down the street much more expensive), it's not too bad. I would probably stay here again for the mere fact that the location is conducing to our activities. But, if I could find another hotel close by with a similar price, I wouldn't mind staying somewhere else.",0

negative,"I purchased this phone on the day of its sale, when there were no reviews available. I made a big mistake in trusting the brand ""Samsung"" blindly. This phone might have pros but they are nothing special. Many smaller brands also provide those features. The one particular flaw that annoyed me the most and made me write this harsh review is lack of notification LED light. This may sound simple but what it means if your phones battery is low you won't notice any warning. If you are charging your phone you don't know if its charging because there is no LED light. If you had a missed call no LED notification. If you had a text no notification. You will know all these only when you turn your screen on. So you turn your phone scree on regularly to check for all these. How the heck did they design a product like this. There are many annoying things in this phone but this one simple feature missing totally pissed me off. On top to rub salt on wounds...Amazon can't do refunds on phones which is a revelation to me. I jumped in and bought this phone in the first week and now I regret trusting Samsung. I already posted it on OLX, can't keep it. My suggestion is don't rush to buy it.",0

Appetizers:
1) Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut)
2) The Original Chopped Salad
Please order both. They were both delicious! I was in love with the salad especially.

Entrees:
1) Lamb Burger (Serbian lepinja roll, pickled cucumber-onion, tzatziki, Kennebec French fries & house made ketchup) I tend to be very picky about my lamb... Actually I'm not reallly a fan of it/the particular taste and smell lamb has. Why I ordered this, I don't know, but I can tell you that I liked it. The taste/odor of lamb wasn't overwhelming and it was juicy.
2) Pan Seared Scallops (Hampshire bacon, roasted corn grits, wilted snow pea greens & Red Rock cola gastrique)
3) Amaro Meatloaf (Montenegro Amaro Italian liqueur, pork, beef, parsnip meatloaf, smashed Yukon gold potatoes, roasted zucchini, veal demi-glace): the server described it as very meaty and meaty it was!

I typically ate bibimbap once a week minimum over there and I can't really tell the difference between Takamatsu's version and the stuff I had on the other side of the Pacific. I noticed they offer a list of other, more obscure foods I learned to love over there, including naengmyeon (cold, spicy noodles), japchae (stir-fried glass noodles), and several other dishes. They also follow tradition and bring you several side dishes. Love it or hate it, kimchi accompanies every meal, as do spicy bean sprouts, a tangy spinach dish and a few other random sides. It's a little bit more expensive than average restaurant prices in the Valley, but definitely worth it when you consider the sides that come with it, and a complimentary spiced tea for ""dessert.""",2

Here's my objective review:

Taberna is in the Scottsdale Seville where Roy's used to be.  They have a large outside patio that will be great when the weather is nice.

I ate lunch at the bar and enjoyed chatting with the friendly bartender.  The menu is upscale Mexican food.  

I liked the basket of chips they brought out to start.  It came mixed with chips and plantains and two nice salsas.

I also ordered the al carbon steak enchiladas.  They were good and spicy served with what I believe was a mole sauce.

Overall the quality of the food was good but a little expensive.  I would come back, but it's not at the top of my list.",1

positive,Mobile is very very good working,2
neutral,"I will make the review short and crisp.

Pros:
Wonderful display. Deep blacks and vibrant colors. AMOLED screen is really very good and better than other AMOLED screens from realme and Mi.

Superb battery. 6000mah is good enough for even hardcore users.

Cons:
Fingerprint scanner takes 2 to 4 seconds to unlock. My old phone which was cheaper than this and 4 years old was unlocking the screen in 0.5 to 1 second.

GPU is slow for supporting PIP. When we have a video playing in Amazon prime and if we press the home button, it takes 3 seconds to show PIP. My old phone used to do it in 1 second. User experience is lost.

Below average camera for this price.

When moving from landscape to portrait, it takes 2 to 3 seconds. My old phone and all Chinese brands do it in 1 second.

Phone gets incredibly hot when charging or when signal 2G/3G strength is low. When I switch to 4G only mode, the issue is resolved. The charging does cause heat in excess of 45 degrees. This may affect the longevity of this phone.

Phone also comes with a very nice quality transparent cover which is a plus.

negative,"Seriously?! With grocery stores like Fresh & Easy, Trader Joe's, and even Safeway around here, I wouldn't go to Whole Foods regularly, for ANYTHING, unless I was a bajillionaire. 1. It's wayyyy overpriced. I'm not sure if there's a Central Market around here as haven't seen one yet, but even that is better than this in terms of price! 

We got a few items here, specialty items in bulk foods, for example. The wine and beer bar is cool, but unlike the Whole Foods in Austin, Tx, which was the epitome of awesome, (2) one can't walk around with beverage in hand here. Too bad the rules are so stringent about that, because if I were shopping with a glass of wine, maybe I wouldn't notice the horrendous prices quite so much.

My 3rd complaint is that when we ordered coffees from the coffee stand there, my mocha and my boyfriend's latte tasted like motor oil, after taking forever to be made, and the girl saw me swipe my card but THEN told me she ""didn't have a register person"" and I wasn't able to cancel the transaction....so then we had to go back through the main grocery line again. Grrr.  I left unsatisfied, uncaffeinated, and feeling like I had just wasted ten bucks on coffee that we ended up pouring out. 

They get one star for having a wine/beer bar at all, but then I have to take that star away because the bar tender said they sold the most beer and wine of any Whole Foods in existence (I call bs - the one in Austin is twelve times busier and people can shop with their beverage of choice, and they have a bunch of restaurants there too so it's truly an experience - it dazzles). This leaves one star for the supply of bulk and specialty items they carry. We went to Trader Joe's after, got twice as much stuff, and spent half as much money. Sayin'.",0

I ordered some sorbet and it was bland - that in itself is an accomplishment - bland sorbet.  The 50's style booth seats were very uncomfortable (maybe to discourage staying long?) and the tables were the wrong height for eating. I had to strain to get above face level of my food (and i'm a normal sized woman) It was also very very (very) loud in here.

I'll avoid going here again. The quality of the product was just too poor - I'd rather hit up a Whole Foods and get some good sorbet without the discomfort and echoing nosie.",0

negative," Please see the attached video. This was my first oneplus purchase. I purchased it on 20th Oct in sale and prepaid 42000. Got it on 24th and as you see it had faulty Android and hanging issue. I was unable to do even initial setup. NOW AMAZON REMOVED THEIR RETURN POLICY. so you can not directly return it, one TAPORI technician will come and he will check whether mobile is really having any issue or not. Trust me he was one of the most unprofessional person I met in my life. But some how he understood my problem and forwarded the issue to Amazon team. So now my replacement will come in next week.
CONCLUSION: I paid 42000 on 20th Oct and I got working mobile on 4th of Nov. This is worst service by Amazon and worst product of Oneplus. Never gone buy any oneplus product again.",0

positive,"oh man, I gained 5 pounds on Sunday but since it was from Joe's I don't even really care - it was that good. 

I won't go into the local ingredients, Agritopia, etc since others already have but it is a wonderful thing. More below.

The food was awesome. Very fresh, delicious and wholesome - you actually felt like you were eating food that was also good for you. Granted we just had the burgers and ice cream but there's a whole menu there to explore on future visits. I loved the signature burger with pesto & fontina, neither of which I had ever thought of but worked very well. The onion rings were good, as were the milkshakes and sundae. It really fills you up fast though, so try to pace yourself!

I was equally enchanted with the setting. Beautiful place. Just like a farm oasis in the midst of suburbia - I hope it doesn't vanish in the midst of the houses all around it. Even the bathroom was noteworthy - clean, black and white with dolls and a closed circuit tv. It reminded me of the Jetsons - you know, the 60s idea of space age. 

Sitting outside wasn't too hot, as it's the one place I've seen so far where the misters really work and don't just spray you and puddle down.  The only down side was when I asked where the farm stand was and the cashier pointed it out, but without mentioning it was closed. Nor was there a sign at the actual location indicating when it would be open in the fall.

Oh, and what was really nice was the sense of everyone relaxing - just kicking back and having a good time. definitely worth going to again, and again ...",2

I have never been here before, so I consulted with my fellow Yelpers for their input.  

The service was quick and prompt.  Our waitress was friendly and on top of things.  I was impressed by the selection of beer, although small, with an offering of Alaskan Amber Ale...mmmm.

We decided to keep things simple this trip.  12 wings, medium flavor, one large margherita pizza with garlic on 1/2.  

GOODS: I LOVE the mozzarella that they use!  I have never tasted cheese this cheesy or this good on my pizza.  NO JOKE.  The wing sauce was also delicious and they provided you with a perfect amount of sauce to cover the wings.  AND, the ranch was NOT watered down, which I am traditionally used to.

BADS:  The parking lot sucks.  We had to park across the street from their main lot to find a spot.  Also, the tomatoes on the pizza were unripe.  Our pizza was soggy in the center, perhaps from the tomato juice during the cooking process, and it made for bad leftovers in the microwave the next day.

Pros

Screen size and crispy display

Cons
Auto Adaptive display is a pain,it never adjust itself as per the ambient light
Battery life , even with moderate usage u have to plug it in 1 day or the very next day early morning
Big size not suited for small hands and difficult to carry.

Anyway my friend suggested this spot because of their sweet potato fries...that's all she had to say, I was down!! It's a trendy little spot inside of a strip mall, it kinda looked outta place but it stood out in a good way.

I ordered the sweet potato fries they were yummy (I like mine a little crispier, but they were still delish)  and the CHINESE CHICKEN SALAD...Mmmmmm the flavors were amazing, the red peppers, cilantro, romaine and that peanuty vinaigrette is too die for! I was a little worried that I wasn't going to get full but this salad was easily large enough for 2.I'm ashamed to say that the 3 times that I have been to Delux I have had this salad, I'm hooked.

positive,"I was looking for a budget smart phone which can perform the entire task for me. I was using MI note 6 and looking for something fresh bcz I was bored with it’s UI. I explored the content available over internet and waited for it to buy after getting the right fitment against my requirement. I am so excited to share my personal experience after my early purchase of this device. I love taking pictures of mine and surrounding too. So great camera quality is one of my main priority, after using it now I must say that it has the best camera available in this budget.
It’s plastic made but mirror finish back panel is the coolest thing in my blue colour device. I also appreciate the makers for understanding our further need and offering the tempered glass and transparent back cover for device protection. Once you will keep the device handy it will give you a feel of it. With the brand tag line of Vivo “Camera & Music” it really impressed me.
I’ll surely recommend my fellow buyers to buy this cool device. But there is also something which can be improved so writing it in bullet points for your ease..
Pros:-
● It’s really a 100% value for money device.
● Run on latest version of Android “9”.
● In Box soft back cover and tempered glass.
● Dedicated kid mode for safety against unwanted operational activity of kids
● Finger print sensor in back of the device is at perfectly placed in the reach of fingers and open the device faster.
● 5000Ah battery, allows to watch many hours online video
● HD+ screen Resolution and balanced colour contrast makes the viewing experience really pleasure and never hurt eyes
● Triple camera with AI and image editing options are among the best features for me
● Fast charging support with 18 watt inbox adaptor
● Snapdragon 665 processor is really a power pack performer even in multitasking
Cons:-
● Lags in PubG (However in a device with 4 GB it’s expected as the game itself take 2 GB space)
● No headphones included
● Front Camera struggles in low light.

At the price of 10990 its a great phone for better multitasking. Vivo has finally started improving specs and is doing good with their phones in the segment.
I hope my review helped you in making your right decision!",2

negative,"Abridged: 
I'm gonna be real with you. I am not in love with Pizzeria Bianco, and had I actually had to wait in line, this rating would probably be lower. My group was lucky enough to receive the last table without any wait.

Maybe it was the fact that it's hard to impress me with pizza. Maybe it was a fluke that won't happen again. At least that's what everyone keeps telling me. But honestly, I just wasn't that impressed with the $19 pizza I received. Sadly, the leftovers I took home ended up being tossed because I was afraid to try it again. 

I've been worried about writing this for awhile (it's been sitting here unfinished for nearly a year), but in the end, my opinions haven't changed, and I sit here, still scared to return. If someone dragged me there again, or had a party there or something, I'd probably give it another shot, as I hate to write off any place after a single trip, but I honestly felt just eh about the whole thing.

positive,"I have to admit: I am impressed.

I have been to a few vegan-only-menu restaurants and I was... underwhelmed. Nothing against the raw food movement, but unless it is a raw-specific place, I expect more creativity. Show me what food can do, be, taste like. Don't just cut it up and toss it on a plate.

Four of us came in to eat on a Saturday and the place was PACKED. A good sign, surely, AND it was a really great mix of demographics: young and old, many nationalities, singles, couples, families... we liked that it had a wide appeal.

The place smelled fantastic, too, so we started perusing the menu long before we had a table to sit at. We waited about ten minutes for a table. It's a bit like a cafeteria in that you order and pay at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.

While we waited we were given a bowl of the ""house soup"" which, basically, was warm carrot water with a piece of carrot or two and some tiny, tiny mushrooms. We all agreed that it needed more of a broth flavor (more types of veg? more mushrooms?), but it was tasty enough and definitely whet our appetites for more.

The spring rolls were really good but needed more. As we removed the peanuts for my friend, I ""blame"" this on us... I will have to have them with the peanuts next time.

The crispy rolls were spiced and savory and light and perfectly crispy. 

My favorite had to be the Pate Chaude. Flaky, savory with a bite from a wonderful combination of spices, and a meatiness from the mushrooms that made us think a die-hard carnivore in our lives may not miss the meat if he were to eat it. THE dish of the day, hands down.

The curries were a bit bland (Save-Planet and Divine Curry Noodles). They were fine, OK, but nothing that made us think we'd come just for that. Much better elsewhere.

The Gracious Spicy Noodle soup was really tasty but it needed a tad more spice. With spicy in the name, we expected more. 

Some stuff is pretty basic: the sushi rolls are basic veggie sushi rolls. The rainbow salad is a tasty but commonplace cabbage and carrot slaw. The fried rice was fried rice. All yummy, all fine to eat, but nothing spectacular, different, or altogether exciting. Basic isn't bad.

Four stars for the surprising and amazing pate chaude and the rolls, for sure. Ideally, 3.5 stars this trip, but I rounded up for the good parts. 

Couldn't go five stars for two reasons: too many items were just basic and the service is slooooooooow. 20+ minutes for fried rice (that we had to ask about)? 25+ minutes for some soup? It was a crap shoot as to what was going to be delivered and when. While they were swamped when we came in, the crowd was thinning out for their afternoon down time (they close from 3p-5p). Overall, our lunch took over 2 hours, most of it waiting on dishes to come out. No bueno if you have other plans that day.

So... tasty, some major standouts, some ""meh, I've had this before."" We *WILL* absolutely go back to give the menu more of a chance to wow us; the ones that knocked us off our feet are worth the return. (Hopefully it's delivered a little faster this time!).",2

>>The app search bar doesn't open with the keyboard automatically.. what's the use of it then
>>The multiple wallpaper option is for lock screen but not the phone wallpaper.. lol

positive,"OK, Sweet Pea and I love us some Coup, and it's not just because we've been coming here for years- since I lived across the street and could see the restaurant from my window- or because we got engaged here (which was incredible.)  It's because the food never disappoints.  You can go to restaurants and have varying experiences from the best meal of your life to terrible, but Coup is not the place for that.  It's consistent.  And consistent can be good, or bad.
As consistently good as the food is, the service is likewise consistently slow (albeit friendly).  We went here for Valentine's day which we've been several times and I highly recommend.  It's romantic without being showy.  They have a special Valentine's Day set menu of 4 courses which is always interesting and good.  And, if you go on the day before Valentine's Day, they still have the menu, but it's cheaper.  Damn those greeting card ""holidays"".  The menu is also consistent.  The outstanding things are the brie brulee which is an absolute must-try as an appetizer, and the lamb shank.  Everything else is solidly good without being great.  The desserts are exceptional.  I like the BYOB aspect of the restaurant, although, they do charge you a lot for ""corking fees"", which amount to just charging you for nothing since they have a corkscrew sitting on the table and you are in charge of opening your own bottle.
Coup, I love you.  You get 5 stars if you vary your menu a little, please, please, please get more vegetarian (if any vegetarian) options, and improve your service.",2

I ordered chicken limone the menu says serves two to three and we don't eat a lot so I figured it would fill us up. The price was 18.99 but I figured in a family style Italian place and we should have plenty of food. 

I was handed my bag and I was sure it was the wrong order because it was so light so I checked it in the car and was shocked. 

I see three small pieces of chicken in a big container with a small piece of bread and that's it! 

So I figured they just forgot the pasta and went back in and asked the hostess and she said yes it comes with it then said no after thinking about it. 

So how can they justify that price? It was so small there was no way it would feed 2 people so I had to cook pasta at home and then reheat our chicken in the microwave.

I worked in the service industry for years and this place is a joke! 

FYI just because there's people with money who live near your restaurant doesn't mean you can tailor your food prices to their income level without delivering value.........if you sell crap in the worst neighborhood that same crap should be priced the same in a affluent neighborhood....same crap different place.

I literally had to tell myself that there are still some gems on Central and that this place was probably one of them. I'm so glad I had that talk with myself. This place is nestled into a great little area of shops and cute patio homes, small businesses and a school. They have a great atmosphere, the inside has roll-up, garage doors and there is a huge patio. 

My friends and I settled into one of the sofa areas and made ourselves comfortable. They have a decent happy hour, all wines are 1/2 off and beer is $2.00 off. We ended up having some wine and a selection of brushetta, all was pretty yummy.  The brushetta wasn't the best I have ever had, but there was a nice selection and it was pretty tasty.  We had the brie and apples (delicious, how could you go wrong), mozzarella and tomatoe (also really yummy), brie and bacon which I didn't try and the tapenade (a little salty, but what can you expect from chopped up olives?).  Once happy hour ended, our very knowledgeable and helpful server told us that for $20 we could get a bottle of wine and another order of brushetta, so we did. Hey, why not, it's Monday!?! 

Ultimately, I was only supposed to stay for an hour (I was sick and jet-lagged and just needed to go home) and I ended up staying for almost four hours. As it got darker, the place took on a very sexy, relaxed vibe. I definitely like the place and I will be back.

1 - Vibration of Notifications ----  I use apps like Twitter, FB as any general user...  - and to be updated- I receive notifications ---  The Most disgusting thing in the phone is  - It keeps vibrating for each notification for each Tweet (by twitter),  any kind of notification, the phone vibrates.  It is so much disturbing that there is no option to disable it.  I have talked to customer care, visited forums but  this is Phone's default feature  rather i will call it as  - Defect feature....  It is so much distressing to keep phone on table or something...  It continues vibration unless the only option is to switch off the phone or disable the mobile data, so that there is no notification.  Haven't even expected from SAMSUNG that this basic feature Or I should say common sense to keep this option (to disable it)  with user is missing in the phone.

2 - Mobile/wifi Internet access to specific app ---  Now, I keep internet access off to specific apps like Netflix, youtube etc for kids Or personal use.  But there is no option to disable internet access to specific app. I have tried using this feature by opting  - Disable Background Access - But this does not serve the purpose, app still gets data and gets updated and it can be used.  Please provide option to the user to restrict data for specific app.

As a new Samsung user, please consider and implement this as feedback in your marketing and product development team ----  Better to focus more on simplicity of using the phone rather than spending on lot of advertisement. Phone lacks very basic features of disabling vibrations and restricting data. These features are most common and available in every phone.",0

1. Went in on a Fri at 630AM for their special curler donuts, that they ONLY do on Fri. Sure enough nothing was prepared. Was informed it would take another 30 min to finish the donuts. Noticeable very, very, very irritated I ordered 2 other donuts instead. Was planning on a dozen, but had to settle for what they had. Well staff made sure to charge me a credit card fee due to my purchase being under $ 5.00. When you don't have what you advertise, you might want to waive the .50 fee. Or you will really piss off that customer. Common sense.

2. Customer service is horrible. See #1.

3. When I get home I have never received the correct dozen donuts I ordered. I don't understand it ???? I'm perplexed ??? I don't think it's anything personal. I just never get the correct dozen. They close the box, I pay and go home. Surprise.

The donuts are OK nothing great and not bad they are donuts. They are convenient and close, but I must remember to pass on Bosa Donuts.",0

positive,"Initially my first choice was to go for the rog phone 2 which had similar price points
But then I realized that paying money for the things which we are not going to use frequently is madness.
Of course in specs the rog phone 2 looks like a heavyweight.
But those are for the people who have never used one plus.
First of all,I got my 7t on the Amazon's Great Indian festival which gave me a discount of 2000 RS which is equal to the rog phone 2(yes u get a discount for 2k but it was out of stock)
Secondly, both phone's do not support sd card,since that I made one plus 7t my cup of tea.
There is a difference between the 90hz and the 120hz display.
But why pay for those if u are not a professional gamer.
The camera on the 7t is way more good than the rog phone 2.
The design is made for professionals and not gamers.
Then comes the software
One plus 7t ships with Android 10 out of the box which is great.
This is the first phone to get Android 10 even before the pixel 4.
Then comes the battery life
I have been using this phone for the past 5 days and I barely charge this device if I am using it at 60hz (that's smoother than the k20 pro).
For 90hz display u will get a screen on time of around 6 if u are a regular user.
For charging speeds, the 7t gets the wrap 30t which is insanely fast. It took me around 58 mins to charge the phone from 0-100 which is definitely the best in the market.
Call quality and signal reception is good even when there is no proper signal reception on my brothers k20 pro.
Face unlock is faster and the fingerprint reader is also improved.
Oxygen 0s!!!!!! Belive me, If u switch to oxygen os,then clearly u will never back off .
For a regular user who does gaming very often, the performance is top notch, the snapdragon 855 plus can handle anything at ease.
Overall one plus has offered a complete package
Finally,
I have no regrets in buying this phone over the rog phone 2........",2

I""ll directly write pros and cons
Cons-
1- Earpiece sound is very bad, you'll hear echo and unclear sound on call.. as well as back side of the earpiece you will feel vibration from the sound coming from earpiece
2- Getting less network in m30s as compare to my other phone in same sim
3- Slow downloading speed from wifi as well as sim internet as compare to other phones.
4- Vibration motor is of very cheap quality.
5- power & volume button are of very cheap quality they will sound like (chit chit) when you'll press it.Very annouing.
6- No app is running in background still 3.1gb memory consumed. Very bad memory management
7- Now the main point- 48mp camera is 48mp only on papers. In real life redmi note 4 can take better picures as compare to fake 48mp camera of m30s
8- super steady mode is zero use it will make your video super grainy and will give heavy jelly effect.. not at all uasable..
9- front camera is no less than a vga camera.. 3rd class
10- pubg is lagging in hdr mode
11- main speaker sounds like 1000rs chinq phone..
12- Some people will find ui pathetic.
13- its back looks cheap & ugly

Pros-
1- battery is very nice
2- screen is too smooth and eye soothing

I typically order chopped salads at lunch.  The chopped turkey & feta salad is what I had today.  I had them add asparagus, which was a great call if I may say so myself!  The large salad and fresh roll is the perfect lunch... fresh, filling, healthy enough, and pretty inexpensive when it comes to designer salads around town.  I also like the spinach, pancetta & goat cheese and the veggie & aged parmesan salads.  

My husband eats at Sauce often as well... he goes for a salad or sandwich.  Last time we were there together, he had the salami, turkey, prosciutto & mozzarella panini.  I had a bite and was pleasantly surprised! It had a nice balance of thin sliced meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato, and tangy red wine vinegar in between two perfectly grilled pieces of bread.  The thin crust pizzas are pretty decent also.  Depending on your appetite, sharing a pizza and a salad with your companion can work out to be a satisfactory meal... 

What I like about Sauce the most? Fast, friendly, and efficient service in a clean and casual environment.  The moderate pricing is also a big plus in my book... especially in this economy.",1

neutral,"Writing review after 20 days of usage
Got this phone in festive season offer. Phone is good overall but it could be better.  I have found few pros and cons which is below.

Pros:
Screen: very good amoled screen. This kind of display found in premium class of Samsung phones but gorilla glass protection is missing.

Battery: Massive 6000 mah battery with great backup.

Weight: phone is feels light weight with 6000 mah battery.  Weight  management is done very well.

Grip is very good so that you can use it without back cover.

Cons:
Camera: It doesn't have EIS. Sharpness is missing in photos. Details missing. Tough it has 48 MP camera, photos looks like 8 MP camera. Samsung needs to work on camera software.

Fingerprint: Fingerprint should be faster than this.  It takes around 1 sec to unlock screen.  Other mobiles are faster than Samsung.

Internet reception is very poor. It works good with continuous usage but it drops reception if you leave for long time. To get it back, you need to turn on and off flight mode.

Lag: Samsung inherited its lagging in this phone as well.  Despite of having 2.3 Ghz processor, phone lags while multi-tasking.

Software improvements are required in this phone.  It doesn't even have spam call blocking facilities.",1

It's honestly ridiculous that they got the superAMOLED display which is super expensive in this price but it's 720p....that's a compromise right there and not a very good one because of the screen size which is a massive 6.5+ inches.

The classes seemed simple enough to me, but there was a client in my class that just wasn't picking it up at all and blatantly disregarding her techniques. I was impressed with how Leah handled the situation and the customer. She's very thorough, and always explains why she does things the way she does, and why it works. So there are no questions, and it's always made perfect sense to me.

The order system is like Pei Wei, line up and order at the counter get a number and sit down. Bad news, the wait was long, the good news, the food is great. I guess, I revealed that I'm impatient and want instant gratification. Thank God that they gave me a cup for coffee after we ordered and got our number to pin on the table on those ""Alligator Clips"". Every time I use those things, I flash back to the early 70's using those clips for that last toke that then gave the super munchies.

Coffee, $2.50 a cup for a bottomless cup with plenty of choices and in a to go cup. Atmosphere.....very hip look, open ceilings, nice patio, great colors and great sayings on the wall to remind us of cool sayings to remember while we nosh. Breakfast came pretty quickly considering how many people were in the restaurant . I had a breakfast burrito that was plump and was plenty of food. I just hoped for more....maybe those alligator clips reminded me of the munchies of the 70's. Sandra had a cinnamon roll and although I thought it could have been bigger....she enjoyed and said ""It was fine and filling"".

I traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.

The restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.

The last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.

All in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.

I entered Mimi's Cafe at the end of possibly worst day ever. I came in looking to order food for takeout and get home to drown my sorrows in comfort food. i was directed by the hostess up front to go stand by the bakery and i would be able to order take out. i waited not 15 seconds and was greeted with a huge smile from a lovely girl named Danielle. She gave me a menu and told me to ask if i had questions and inquired if i had been there before. i looked at the menu for some time, unable to clear my mind enough to decide. She told me i was welcome to take a seat, and when i apologized for taking so long she responded with a smiley ""where's the fire? take your time, can i get you a glass of wine while you decide?"" wine was a perfect idea! I finally ordered and sat drinking my wine. i waited, and then waited a little longer, Danielle the young girl doing take out informed me the kitchen was working as fast as they could but are very busy, she apologized for the wait and offered complimentary bread  and convinced me to buy a a second glass of wine. When she brought me the second glass i had just gotten off the phone and was visibly shaken with more bad news. Somehow this young girl had the courage to ask if everything was alright and what she could do to help. It was just the olive branch i needed. Just the inquiry was enough to make me feel better. i told her i was fine and thanked her for her compassion. finally my food was ready. She boxed everything with care for the drive home. All this time smiling. i couldn't help but notice Danielle interact with the other employees they always laughed or high fived her with each exchange. She had brightened my day, and it was clear she is a light for others in Mimi's Cafe. This is the kicker...my bill was $30 and some change...i gave her what i thought was two $20 dollar bills, but in reality was a $50 and a $20. The young girl ran outside and stopped me saying sir, I'm not sure these bills are right. i was overwhelmed by her honesty and told her no, i thought they were two 20's but the difference would be her reward for honesty. The food was tasty and just what i needed. Mimi's Cafe is a friendly place worth the wait for food or a table, and if Mimi's Cafe reads these reviews know that you have a superstar in Danielle.",2

neutral,"I had bought the Mi Note 8 Pro for the first time on Nov 6, 2019. However, having set up the device I started facing issues with the headphone jack. Every single time I connected any Aux device to the phone, the connection was intermittently interrupted and the music/media would automatically pause for that reason, thus creating issues with continuous playback.
Pursuant to the same I got a replacement done and received a new device. However I am still facing the same connectivity issues with the Aux jack with no immediate remedy in sight. It seems most probably a software issue, however quite disappointing to have to face this on a new Mi device. Perhaps and hopefully the same may get remedied with future updates.

Dear lord. The food is awful here. Inedible. Tastes very distinctly like a bad frozen dinner.  The only thing I remember being remotely food-like was some kind of beef and onion dish.. which tasted a bit like a philly cheesesteak. not exactly asian fare..

I tried really hard to like this place. My boyfriend didn't like any of it either. I don't understand how they have such good ratings. The ONLY thing I like about this place is their dessert bar, because they have toppings for the frozen yogurt. It always annoyed me how so many buffets don't even have sprinkles.. so they've got that going for them.. though I think I'll just go to Mojo or Yogurtland. haha.

positive,"First read about this in the recent 2009 Best of Phoenix and wow, what a great choice! The place is cozy and friendly (laidback atmosphere) with food that is a wonderful culinary experience. I enjoyed the roasted garlic in olive oil with the toasted baguette slices from the start menu, though the nosh plate might need some work (more types of cured meats, and maybe some of those tiny dill pickles). 

From the starter plates we had the crostini duo and the roasted grapes and brie on the multi-grain bread slices was popular with all - the one with the cucumber slices on them, a distant and less exciting second. The other starter - dates stuffed with homemade Chorizo and grueyer cheese, yum! The come on a bed of greens with some sort of vinegar dressing, which was a nice compliment.

For Sharing Section of the menu - the citrus brined fried chicken and cheddar cheese waffles, loved by all! I recommend ordering it early since we asked for it about 7 pm and it was the last one left. Even the braised greens were good. I was not so impressed with the halibut filet plate  - nicely seasoned but frankly, a bit dry.

Other thoughts - they really like cucumber here - they put it in the water (makes it quite refreshing), garnished my gin and tonic with it (homemade tonic, nice but not really wowed by it), and had it on the previously mentioned crostini duo plate - just seemed like a lot of cucumer. As for the service, it was good throughout the meal. The waiter kept things well paced and was a good source of information when asked, without being overly obtrusive.

positive,"In my book Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks are on the top tier of the coffee shop pyramid. Because this Dunkin Donuts is a couple hundred feet north of Starbucks in this Wal-Mart power center, this location is the opportune review to compare the strengths and weaknesses of each chain using characteristics of these locations.

FOOD

   Dunkin Donuts blows Starbucks out of the Phoenix Valley when it comes to food. Whereas I am a fan that goes back to my teen years of Dunkin Donuts toasted bagels with cream cheese, I regard Starbucks bagels as filler food that tastes equivalent to a supermarket bagel. Dunkin Donuts signature donuts are the bomb. Starbucks pastries are filling yet forgettable.

COFFEE

    Long before Starbucks landed on New York soil in the 90s, Dunkin Donuts coffee was the ultimate cup of Joe. In a way Dunkin Donuts is still the ultimate cup of Joe. In my mind their coffee is slightly better than Starbucks. Especially with their added light blueberry syrup.

PRICE

   Dunkin Donuts coffee is relatively the same price as Starbucks. Whether I buy a coffee with syrup or ice blended coffee beverage at Dunkin Donuts or Starbucks, the difference in price is relatively zilch.

SERVICE

   Dunkin Donuts trails behind Starbucks in service. Especially at these locations. At Dunkin Donuts, one man was manning the shop. If there was a rush in business, this would cause customer service issues. On the other hand Starbucks had a crew of employees. The woman who took my order was very charming and friendly. Dunkin Donuts service does have one advantage over Starbucks, which is the employees put in the cream and sugar for you.

COFFEE SHOP EXPERIENCE

  As far as a place to hang out, Dunkin Donuts trails far behind Starbucks. This is another Dunkin Donuts where the subliminal message is to sip your coffee eat your food and move on. Starbucks on the other hand promotes hanging out with complimentary WiFi and comfortable seating.",2
negative, WHAT! That`s a sin!,0
neutral,"Dined here for the first time tonight. The food was..A-OK! Certainly not authentic Mediterranean food but I don't think it is trying to be. The first thing we noticed when we walked in was the loudness.  Way. Too. Damn. Loud. From an acoustician's standpoint, all the hard surfaces and the cavernous dining room make for a very loud joint. This is a big minus in my book.

On to the food!  We ordered the beef gyro sandwich.  Very average but tasty nonetheless. Checked out the lentils and rice salad served warm over a bed of lettuce and veggies with dressing. Sadly, this was a bit of a miss for me. The rice was quite mushy and just didn't stand up to the heft of the lentils. The taste itself was quite fine but I couldn't get past the texture. Also, if you order this dish, know that the grain/legume level far outweighs the veggies. A huge portion (which is great for the pocketbook) but beware if you're watching carbs. The salad below was actually refreshing but all in all, the dish just wasn't for me. 

Also had the dolmades which were quite nice served cold (albeit a little overstuffed for my liking).  Our server was very good, very accommodating with special requests.  Service was a bright spot for sure.

Without a doubt, while I didn't LOVE the food here, it was tasty enough for me to come back again and give it another try!",1

positive,"DISLIKES:
I ordered the phone on sake day at 1 PM with delivery on the same day.
But Samsung shocked me by giving defective product
  Defects:
No sound will be produced by the phone in any of the below ways:
-headphone audioJack not working
-caller audio receiver not working
-speaker not working

Videos won't be played in the normal speed.It will only play at 2× speed.

Being the Samsung user in the form of TV,bluetooth neckband and mobiles for many years.I am upset in receiving the defective product on the opening day.Hope they will be taking care of quality control.

LIKES:
Replacement accepted and there comes the mega monster.Excellent performance with RAM Management,battery and  camera.

Samsung interface provides seamless usage.After receiving the quality product I even forgot about the bad first impression  created.

WHO can Buy:
-Camera is priority
-Wants some bigger battery
-day to day regular usage
-Normal gamers.Gaming performance is good.Any game can be played,but not at very very high configuration.

For this price,other Chinese products may assure more specs but the brand value decides the mobile life.Think wisely

PHONE WONT' SATISFY:
-Gamer addicts.But you can look for A71.
-onscreen finger print sensor-A51

Now I have recommended the phone in my friend's circle too.
For this price,this is a real mega monster.

REVIEW is about positive's and negative's.
Samsung should have eye on negative points keenly and that should be helping them to overcome the barrier.

Hope,I will be getting the JBL headphone for my review and Samsung won't betray me in this by giving the prize to positive reviewer's😁",2

neutral,"Here is my honest assessment of Los Reyes de la Torta.  It's a three-star place.  The atmosphere is a bit dumpy.  My apologies to those who think reviews should focus strictly on food, but atmosphere is what I notice when I walk in the door.  Plus, despite the fact that the place was mostly, we were led to the table closest to the restrooms.  Seriously?  

The star of the show here is obviously the tortas.  I tried the egg one, which had cheese and a very generous serving of sliced avocados.  This torta was delicious and a great value.  The other one I tried had chicken, onions, and some other stuff.  It reminded me of what they have at the Great Steak and Potato Company.  Not that that's a bad thing.  For the tortas I give 5 stars.  

Other stuff:

No alcohol.  'Nuff said.

Greasy potato chips as a side?  That was kind of a bummer.  I was craving tortilla chips or fries or anything a little more exciting than potato chips right out of the bag.

The flan was really dense and tasted like it was prepared forever ago in a huge vat.  Skip it.  You probably won't be hungry anyway after the tortas so don't get tempted by the pictures on the menu.",1

positive,"I honestly just got home from visiting Super Farm!  I headed out their way because I wanted to try their milk - we are trying to spend our $$ on local businesses.  It was great to actually speak to the people who raise the cows and see the cows with my own eyes! 

We ended up staying for about two hours!  Everyone was so friendly.  We bought our gallon of milk ($3.49) and some butter ($4.99) and then stayed for lunch.  Chef Matt - I hope I didn't forget his name!- introduced himself while we were buying milk and we decided to stay for lunch . The kids split a kid's cheeseburger and I had the chicken salad - sandwich.  It was fantastic!! 

After lunch we visited the baby cows, the goats, and then stopped and had a big glass of flavored milk ($1 each - grape for my 2 yr old daughter and chocolate for my 4 yr old son).  

Everyone is so nice here - my children LOVED it and did not want to leave.  Worth the 40-ish minute drive out there.  (We live in South Phoenix)",2

I'm fairly mental for their Chicken Soft Tacos on corn tortillas. Larger than a typical street taco, they are almost sized more like a mini burrito - Shredded Chicken, a red pepper sauce, lettuce, and melted cheddar = AWESOME. Tuesdays they are only $1, all day!  Finally their Adobada tacos are a bargain at thrice the price. Avoid the Chili Relleno burrito, however. It may be one of the worst things to ever get passed through a drive-thru window.",2

The cemras do need some more work which and sure will be fixed over software updates in the days to come. I do Miss the headphone jack but we also miss days where global warming was not a thing!!

Battery is not as good as the other OnePlus phones all cause the display is a power hungry Led, thanks to the 90hz refresh rate. Drop it to 60hz and voila your good to go!! But then if you would do that, there is no sense in buying this phone in the first place. And also you have Dash Charge 30T. Which charges your phone lighting fast....

negative,"AMAZON sent it in two days.  128GB opal black . Looks  really  nice. But feels cheap. Samsung is a well known OEM. I never use samsung before. As they febricate their own processor, memory, display etc, I thought it will be better. The proven disappointment are in below.
Pros:
6000mAh battery (though it's not real) and 15 watt 'fast charger' charge my phone from 10% to 100% in 2Hr40min.

Cons:
1. camera works average in sunny day(my redmi note 4 took better photos.), useless wide angle (better to use panorama). Super useless  night mode (again redmi note 4 with g-cam took  way better  photos  in night). Color correction  in daylight  is somewhat good but at artificial  lighting  conditions it sucks.
2. Gaming.  Expected disappointment as usual from Samsung.
3. Slow finger print sensor. Some time it don't work.
4. Yellowish screen. The white tone changes when  u see the screen  from side angle.
5. Low speaker output. And bad speaker  sounds quality during call.
6. Small data cable.. and cheap quality.
7. At least  a pre-applied screen  protector  should be there or a silicon case.
8. Draws 7% power in one hour in ideal mode when the data is active with no app in app drawer.
9. Problem with adaptive brightness control.
10. Buggy compass sensor, need frequent calibration during navigation.
11. Low signal reception.

For better phone in same price go for realme xt or 5 pro or poco f1,

neutral,"After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention:
1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it.
2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight.
3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick.
4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi.
  I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone.
To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi.
Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.",1

Sound is not so loud though it has got dual speakers. Biggest problem of this phone is it has different charger where in you have to always carry its own charger or because it has very low battery backup. One more biggest problem with this phone is it doesn't have separate audio jack where in now a days almost all phones have 3.1 audio jack for earphones. Over all you can give credits to this phone only for it's storage and camera other wise this phone is of not much user friendly as now a days everybody is accustomed to use android phones.",0

negative,"I've now tried Thai Elephant three times.  My first two experiences were solidly mediocre -- nothing was awful, but aside from one delicious dessert (black sticky rice with pumpkin custard), nothing stood out, either.  As a recent Bay Area transplant, I admit to being a bit picky, but in my 6 months in Phoenix, I've found several places that more than satisfy my rather frequent Thai cravings (Swadee in Chandler, Thai Lahna in Arcadia, Sala Thai in North Phoenix, and, in a pinch, Thai Hut in Central Phoenix).  Until now, Thai Elephant hadn't really done it for me, but since the restaurant is literally 40 feet from my office and since other Yelpers seem to have had positive experiences, I was reluctant to give up on Thai Elephant without giving it another chance.

On Friday, looking forward to a relaxing night at home, I called in an order for Pad Thai with chicken, Panang Curry with beef (extra spicy), and Spicy Eggplant with tofu (spicy, which I thought would be automatic given the name, but apparently wasn't).  I got home, meted out ridiculously oversized portions of the three entrees, and sat down to enjoy my feast.

Wow.  I don't know quite where to begin, but to say that I was disappointed doesn't begin to cover it.  The Pad Thai was about on par with the Taste of Thai boxed dinners you can pick up at the grocery store, only less flavorful; marginal at best, but edible.  The chicken didn't stand out as being of particularly low quality, but the noodles were some of the worst I've had at a Thai restaurant (some bites were underdone to the point of being crunchy, while others were seriously soggy).

Sadly, the sub-par Pad Thai was the high point of the meal by a wide margin.  The Spicy Eggplant was a bland stir fry of soggy, overcooked vegetables and limp tofu.  The tofu appeared to have been fried as a large block and then sliced, and a few small pieces of eggplant were thrown in for good measure.  The Panang Curry with beef was even worse.  Though I ordered the dish ""spicy,"" the curry tasted like straight coconut milk with a few drops of red food coloring thrown in.  The beef was the last straw for me; it very may well have been the worst quality, most gristly meat I've had at any restaurant I've ever been to.  I tried several pieces, and all were similarly inedible.

I really, really want to like Thai Elephant, but after the experience I had, I don't know if I can bring myself to give it another chance -- especially since I've found so many other good Thai restaurants in the Valley and since the second-worst Thai meal I've had since moving here was at Thai Elephant's sister restaurant, Thai Basil in Ahwatukee.",0

I asked ahead of time if they used white meat and was told yes, but the ""Calypso Pasta"" I ordered had tiny, tiny pieces of dark meat jerk chicken...instead of the boneless white strips I was expecting, and really it was just mediocre.

Unfortunately they seem to have a hard time keeping some of my favorite items in stock, I wonder if this is a result of some of the import restrictions/delays that have been a result of the recent quality issues with food and toys imported from China.

I'm half Chinese and spent much of my youth being dragged around Chinatown near L.A. by my grandmother and 6 or 7 aunts. So the 99 Ranch Market brings back memories...some fond...some not quite so. But, at any rate, the prices are great and the selection is good and authentic (when it's in stock). The cashiers could use a little dosing from the friendly fairy, however. Then again, I don't remember many friendly cashiers or clerks at any of the stores I frequented as a kid...so I guess it just makes the experience all the more genuine for me.

Special note - if you aren't that hungry - don't go here.  Go somewhere else where you can split your meal or take 1/2 home.  Here that 1/2 a plate of salad greens is going to cost you just as much as the guy on his 4th plate.",1

It offers us a wide range of features whether it is about battery life, fingerprint sensor or daylight picture quality.

After all it is sum up of all features which is offered by other brands in higher prices.

The facility is pleasant, immaculate and huge - and available to students for practice at any time, not just during their lessons.
As mentioned in a previous review, they have a great deal for first time students.  The best thing for couples is that the price per lesson is the same whether for a single or a couple.   Because I've only done one lesson, and my first dance lesson every (well since high school, but the dinosaurs because extinct since then),  I'm looking forward to more lessons and the opportunity to add a star.",2

positive,"This is the fastest phone I've ever laid my hands on. I never thought speed would make such a difference. Mid range phones are very good these days making flagship phones less attractive. But this phone is just so fast, it makes all that extra money you put in worthwhile. This phone will be good for 3 years easily just because of the specs and power. You can directly upgrade from this phone to a good foldable in 3 years. Stock camera disappoints sometimes in certain scenarios but gcam comes to the rescue. You cannot blindly open the stock cam in an urgent situation. Keep both and use whichever you think will suit the situation. That's the only minor problem with this phone. Also the fingerprint reader isn't perfect. I suggest registering each of your fingers twice to improve results. Otherwise everything is perfect. Screen ,battery life, performance, speakers, charging speed, UI, in hand feel and touch response. It's all 5 out of 5! The price is the cherry on the cake. I don't know why people are still buying Note 10s and Pixels. This phone has everything at half the price. I have a pixel too and honestly I liked the software of the Oneplus better! It's that clean. 128 gb is more than enough for most people.
For 33K this phone is a steal. If this is your first time with OnePlus and doubting the brand. Just don't. The phone comes with 2 year warranty and free pick up and drop for any service issues. That's the kind of focus the brand is putting in here. So don't worry about the reliability.",2

The brisket also had a very dark pink smoke ring and good smoky flavor. the bbq sauces are good but nothing special. The platters come with 2 side dishes and I was pleasantly surprised that the veggies were not boiled to death. The carrot strips were just the right tenderness and sweet, and the broccoli was slightly crunchy. My other side dish was the sweet potato fries. They were good and went well with the BBQ sauce.

negative,"Honestly the drinks are overpriced and have a hint of rubbing alcohol
Honestly my lunch was just okay
Honestly they have a drink called the stigmata
Honestly I am dreading having to give them 2 stars given the hype

But, I am supposed to be honest.

This place has been the buzz since before I returned stateside. My coworkers had also been hearing the same buzz. We just had to go as the finale to our week of lunch. Yeah, I probably would've been better off at the Billet Bar across the street. I mean it is biker week. The people watching would've been stellar. The only people watching I had at RnR was the gorgeous server outside our window on the patio. But even his piece of art body won't bring me back.

The first hint should've really been the overpriced drinks we started with. I figured for that price they should be damn good so I ordered some lime concoction. A coworker got the stigmata. Holy strong... and not in a good way. I mean, I appreciate my drink as much as the next but not when I can't even enjoy it. 

One of my other coworkers on the other hand, was enjoying his blue moon. That was until he held it up to take another sip and the entire bottom of his glass fell off.. yes.. fell in one piece.. onto our table. What happened to the contents do you ask? That went all over him, the table, inside someone's wallet, and onto an iPhone and my face. The waiter wasn't even really apologetic about it aside from giving us some extra cloth napkins which weren't soaking anything up at all. No wet rag, no comp, no apology, nothing but another glass of blue moon we were hoping wasn't bought at a prank store and a sticky table, faces, and sunglasses.

The chicken lollipops were not what I expected, but really weren't bad. I did enjoy those. I also enjoyed the presentation of my fries. Cute silver bucket. Tons of fries. Couldn't finish.

I ended up getting a chicken sandwich that had brie and some other goodness on it. Totally forgot to order it without tomato, but I picked it off easily. 

I know what you're thinking, they serve breakfast here til 2pm, why the hell did the breakfast queen not order breakfast. Honestly, none of it wooed me enough that it looked delicious. They had a make your own omelet that was on my short list of things to order, but I'm glad I didn't after seeing a coworker's tiny ass omelet and bread with no other side for $10. Also, I highly doubt their Amish french toast is all that Amish. Just sayin'. I know a bit or two about Amish goodness.

So, back to my lunch.. it was just eh, which was sad. The description sounded so delicious I really was expecting to be wowed.. finally.. after all the mishaps I'd had up until this point. I do admit I loved the bread. It was delicious. I also appreciated that despite them not having honey mustard, aioli, or anything else to dip my fries in aside from ketchup and barbeque sauce (which was given with the sweet potato fries.. ew) they tried to make me honey mustard. Unfortunately it was just honey mixed in with bottle mustard ketchup. I ended up using the ranch dressing from the lollipops. 

What I paid for this was ridiculous.
The way they reacted to the beer mishap was ridiculous.
The food was meh.
Not even I was tempted to try breakfast there.
It was like the beautiful model that has no brains.... and I want some brain thought going into my dining experience. Don't try to woo me with simple sex appeal.

One of my coworkers commented that maybe in 6 months when the pans are seasoned well after being used the place will be worth it to try again. I told him maybe.

positive,"Vaguely remembered this place from Yelp when we were looking for a lunch spot after a visit to the Acxupuncturist up the street. We pulled into the lot and by the looks of the outside, there was a bit hesitancy to go in. So, thank you to my friend's smartphone for allowing us to read the yelp reviews and allow us to take a chance on this place. I am happy to say our first visit was a good one. 

Everyone has said already, it is homey and maybe a bit dated in its decor. However, I don't care for ambiance and classy settings, I care about decent food and friendly service.

MMR has both. I had the Hot Turkey lunch special for Thursdays and I have to say  it was huge for a lunch plate and the price was so reasonable. Maybe I am old school, but when you bring me hot bread and butter right after I order, you have already won me over. Then the Turkey Plate came and it was really good, moist and flavorful. The potatoes are not mashed, they are smashed-there are actually potato chunks in there. I was not thrilled with the stuffing because IMO it had too much sage (to the point of overpowering) in it and that was distracting me from what otherwise would have been a very good stuffing. There was also  MORE  BREAD given to me with my meal in the form of a roll. That was good because I needed it to dip in the copious amounts of gravy on the plate. 

Mia was our server and she was really great. Very attentive, helpful and actually seemed to enjoy serving us. Rare these days. This staff has it together. 
 
We were stuffed and decided to opt-out on dessert and take an APPLE  pie to-go. The pie was still warm when she brought us the box and it traveled well for 3 hours all the way to Marana. My friends boyfriend is  the pie lover and he had two slices after dinner that night and I can say we all loved it. I ate a slice for breakfast the next day. Excellent, excellent  pie. 

Our two lunches, two beverages and a pie to go was $35, considering the pie was about 1/3 of that, not bad at all. 

We go to the acupuncturist this Tuesday and I plan on getting more yumminess from MMR.",2

positive,"Having long followed the Xiaomi MiA series, from the MiA1 & MiA2, the hardware and features have always been very good, with assured OS updates up to 2 years. With this I decided to get the MiA3, and it has been a good experience.

The good: Being stock android, without a skin and without bloatware, everything feels clean and fast. 6GB RAM and the SD 665 processor are sufficient for day to day tasks.
The main 48 MP camera (Sony sensor, used in so many different phones including the Redmi K20 and K20 Pro, Oneplus 7 series, etc.) is really good with details and in most conditions the exposure and white balance is good. This can be further bettered with different camera apps, even the Gcam port for the phone (as the phone supports camera 2 API). The wide angle camera isn't as sharp as the primary camera, but it is quite decent for what it is, specially in day light conditions (indoor and low light photos turn out quite soft).
The battery life is pretty good, heavy usage lasting for the whole day (mainly media consumptions and playing games). Call quality and dual network reception is great as well.

The mediocre/bad:
The only complaint I have with the phone is the slow fingerprint reader, and I knew about it before I purchased the phone - I can live with it because the rest of the package is good value for the price. The display, while being OLED, is bright enough and generally enjoyable, but the resolution and perceived sharpness is a little less than some other phones. It is not bad, just OK.

Everything else was pretty authentic, based on my experiences. Our first time with the Chaat bar... I really don't get it.

-Camera(2): No detail in photos when compared to other high end models in the market. Nevertheless the photos are amazing and you cannot find anything bad when you glance at it.

positive,"I don't do heavy gaming, so I can't give you a review there.  My predominant focus is video streaming--Netflix, Prime Video, Youtube, etc. I tend to binge-watch through weekend nights, and this phone is perfect for that.  It has Widevine support, thanks to which I can stream content full-screen, in HD.  The quality of the display is great.  I had my reservations there, but it's hard to believe it's ""just"" a TFT panel.  Of course, not of OLED/AMOLED quality, but you'd be hardpressed to find much in the way of difference between this and an IPS.  The battery life is great, and, even when you're running low, Type C/Quick Charge work well in bringing up the battery to full in a matter of time.  Sound output (through the headphones) is good, and I've had no problems with signal reception/call quality either.  Though I have just a 3 GB version, I haven't faced any lag or app crashes whatsoever, so top marks there as well (though, again, I don't do heavy gaming, as I've said).

It may not be metal and glass, but the build quality is top-notch.  Being someone that doesn't like using cases/covers, that's a plus for me.  I have an Honor 8x (which I've now handed over to someone in my family), and, while that phone looks really premium, it didn't take long for the back to pick up scratches.  Yes, you could mitigate that by using covers, but it defeats the purpose, having a pretty phone, only to shroud it under a cover.

The one real downside is the camera.  It's average to above average at best, but, for all that's Samsung's given at this price point (11-13K), it would be wrong to ask for more, especially when you're not paying more.

All in all, it's a really good device.  Samsung only had lackluster offerings in this price segment all these years, and it's good to see Samsung now take on the competition.  And, of course, you have that Samsung service, which is miles ahead of the so-called (and ever so frustrating) after-sales service that MI offers.",2

No complimentary chips and salsa which would be ok if they offered something else like Barrio. No happy hour either which was disappointing.

The street corn was good, but I've had much better. The butternut squash tacos were out of this world. My husband liked them better than his mahi tacos.

positive,"My wife and I decided to take a little vaca to celebrate our 13th anniversary and also was the first time that we were traveling with our 5-month old, so you can imagine we were a little apprehensive. 

The resort is absolutely top-notch, the rooms are very spacious, the staff is very courteous, and the facilities are simply superb.  Our room overlooked the mountain, and in the morning, it was blissful to sit outside and sip on our cups of joe. 

The rooms have a microwave and a small fridge, something that was invaluable to us to store milk and warm it up for our little one.  The spa is simply one of the best in the valley, and even if you don't stay here, I would recommend the spa to anyone.  The resort is close to at least 20 golf courses, something that might be important to other golf nuts like me. 

So then why not 5 stars? Simply because they would not extend the check-out time for us by even an hour.  The check-out is 11 am and our flight was delayed to 8 pm, so when I requested, I was told VERY NICELY, but firmly that it wasn't going to happen.  I've traveled some, and have NEVER been turned down for a late check-out request, ever. 

Still, a great place to stay, the facilities are top-notch, the staff is very nice, and we had a wonderful time.  Would recommend this to anyone wanting a relaxing, fun experience in the Valley of the Sun.  Cheers.",2

I can't remember what we had our first visit, it was right after they opened and during the awkward stage. The second visit we had pizza it was good, we were looking for deep dish which they don't make but it was good and great service. 

Tonight we all had different things: Mostaccioli for my older son he was very happy, cheesy and flavorful sauce. Spaghetti and meatball off the kid's menu for the younger boy, sweet sauce and a big meatball another happy boy. Husband had the Chicago Grinder hot and it was gone in a flash and he said it was really good. It looked great on the toasted bread. He also got a salad instead of fries, lots of fresh veggies. I had the Italian Beef with peppers and onions, it comes with Giardiniera and au jus and french fries. The bread was yummy soft yet substantial enough to withstand au jus. The bread was stuffed, stuffed with meat, the peppers and onions were good but the giadiniera made it. It was a really good sandwich. San Tan Brewery on tap - yum.

I could give them 5 stars but I've had better Italian Beef though I will admit I'm not an expert.

And can handle day to day work easily and can handle anything you throw at it. But the major deal-breaker can be that Xiaomi doesn't send MIUI updates frequently since Snapdragon chipsets get more frequent updates.

I have been using the phone now for 4 months straight and i have received only one update which eas so called MIUI 11 based on Android 9. To sum up here are the pros and cons.
Pros:-
Fast and smooth performance
Screen is quite good.
Battery backup(can easily last more than a day)
Fast charging
Premium look and feel.
Cons:-
Display isn't an Amoled
Gets heated up quite
No Android 10 yet.

Conclusion:-. If you're someone who doesn't care much about updates then just go for it since the performance on this is exceptionally good like seriously.",1

My boyfriend's favorite food is BBQ-anything so I left the ordering up to him (and the choice was easy): Whole Hog Heaven - 4 meat choices plus 3 sides. Settling on St. Louis and Baby Back Ribs, BBQ Chicken, and Brisket, with sides of mac & cheese, coleslaw, and beans - he was as giddy as a kid on Christmas. I was pretty hungry too - and I had to admit the smell of BBQ wafting through the back kitchen door had my taste buds excited. The meal did not disappoint to say the least. The ribs were literally falling off the bone, the chicken was cooked perfectly, and the brisket was melt-in-your-mouth tender. All 3 sides were the perfect addition, however I do have to say that the coleslaw was my favorite, especially paired with the brisket. 
What sent us over the edge of BBQ heaven were the extra special additions before and after the meal. To start us off - homemade, warm cornbread with whipped butter. To finish us off - complimentary mini donuts (yes, you heard me right).

Pros:
1. 90FPS ( you can feel it for sure)
2. Fluid AMOLED display
3. A pretty good camera (you can compare it with Samsung 10 series)
4. Price
5. Latest processor
6. OS and security updates

Cons:
1. Battery - With a 90fps display, the camera isn't that great. However, it will last a day and also gives you an option to choose 60fps to save some battery juice.
2. Hugh camera bump - you should avoid this phone if you prefer to use this phone with no case cover
3. Slippery (not a con, since most of the phones are slippery)

You can go for it as this is the 3rd best android device in the market now next to Asus ROG 2 and OnePlus 7T Pro. You will definitely find this phone worth your month for sure.",2

neutral,"I love burgers and really wanted to love The Grind, but it wasn't meant to be. Unfortunately I had problems with the temperatures, both the restaurant and the food.

I was here with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night. The restaurant itself is nicely appointed, with a sleek, modern look and feel. It was pretty close to full, but staff were still friendly and efficient. 

The $5/glass wine special they were running was very nice. I has the peppercorn burger with sweet potato fritters. The fritters were very nice, crunch without being greasy, and not overly sweet. The burger was nicely composed with great toppings and flavors - the watercress in particular stood out. Unfortunately, the burger was also well, well done, and I had ordered medium. I should have sent it back, but was hungry and didn't want to wait. For a burger joint missing a temperature on a burger is pretty disappointing and it killed a lot of the goodwill the rest of the ingredients had built up. 

The bread pudding for desert wasn't the best I've ever had, but was nice and the bourbon sauce it came with was a nice touch. 

The other issue I had with The Grind is the temp inside the restaurant. I'll grant that these are the dog days of summer right now, and I'm sure it's hard to keep the place cool with the half open kitchen, but was pretty warm in there.

With the wine special it was ok value for the money I guess. But on a normal night with $10-12/glass for wine and $10 for a burger with another $4 for fries it's too pricey for my tastes, especially if they aren't hitting proper temps on the burgers every time.",1

positive,"After nearly 13 days of usage of Samsung Galaxy M30 I am writing this review. This phone is amazing in all aspects (ie) looks, camera, Performance and volume of media and ringtones and not to forget the Bahubhali Battery, and the wonder is it's with a 18w Quick charger. This phone can run for 1½ days to 2 days very comfortably with normal usage like calls, WhatsApp and music and YouTube streaming. Playing big sized games like PubG might drain faster. Otherwise 2 days is possible. I have used several phones before but this is one of the best now.
The Amoled screen gives an unmatched picture contrasting.  The camera pictures are also amazing even the indoor lighting and pitch dark images turned out good. The live focus feature gives the DSLR image result with perfect background blur. Even in the pitch dark your selfie come good as the Led screen brightens sufficientlyto enhance the picture. The volume usually is insufficient in a what'sApp video calling for many phones, this is the first experience where I had to reduce the Volume by 25 to 30 % as it was too loud. Also the music player is wonderful  but supports Dolby Atmos only in the Earphone or bluetooth modes as the phone come with only single side speaker. At this mid range pricing of Rs13990/- when you get a Samsung phone with a superb battery and camera and 4 GB ram,  I'll call it a ""Killer deal."". I'm actually more than happy. So far No regrets.",2

positive,"I cannot believe I am about to say this:
AIRPORT FOOD IS GOOD.

For any of you who eat in airports on a regular basis, you've surely come to accept the fact that airport food just sucks.  It doesn't matter how much you spend:  the bread is stale or soggy, meats are dry and tasteless, and forget fresh veggies and fruits of any quality.

I was just shocked when I visited the Roadhouse at Sky Harbor recently.  I had an hour before my flight so I ordered a Stella Artois and a french dip.  I wish I'd had a camera to catch my expression when I bit into my sandwich.  The bread was soft and warm.  The meat was tender and tasty.  The cheese was really good; no joke this was real cheese.  And HOT au jus?  

OMFG I almost freaked out it was so good!  I couldn't wait to tell my server how pleasantly surprised I was.  She kinda laughed at me and said they get compliments on their food all the time.  AT AN AIRPORT?  Folks, this is the best kept secret at Sky Harbor.  I will make it a point to go out of my way to eat there in the future, even if my gate is in another termial!!

This place is in the low B gates - try it and you won't regret it!",2

Other phones Samsung don't give 6000 mah battery with the 64 MP camera and super amoled full HD display altogether at this rate.
15W fast charger takes almost 1.5-2 hours to charge this big batteryvwhich lasts for almost 2 days with normal internet and other uses.

positive,"A definite welcome to the neighborhood!! 

I was delightfully surprised at how much the store offers in such a small space. Grant it you are not going to get many choices on some items, but you may be surprised at some of the items you do find. There were plenty of choices for organic foods and ""green"" products, also. 

The good:
convenience - for those of you that has one in your neighborhood. Easy to get in and out of with front door parking.

PRICE - The prices are as low as Walmart's but without the hassle of having to deal with the super-store size. (they accept coupons too - even better) 

Ready meals - Great concept. Many places do this, but I found that it was easy (and fun) to create a full meal. Main courses, salads, sides, sandwiches and desserts all labeled and located in one place. If you don't have time to cook give it a shot. It is not as cheap as cooking it yourself but lasagna for two people for six bucks isn't bad. 

The bad:
Stay away from the Rotisserie Chicken. A little dry and over-cooked. I've had better at Fry's, Costco. Save your tastebuds.

In a world of Mega-stores with mega-parkiing lots it is nice to have a place that is actually cheaper to go to and within walking distance. 

The best way to describe Marketside is if you were to cram the Walmart food section and the Wholefoods quality and organic cool factor  in a space the size of Walgreens.",2

Went to breakfast with Deb L, and she had a Living Social deal or one of those deal thingies. The place was packed, probably because it's a holiday week.

That doesn't excuse the EXTREMELY poor service. We sat down and waited. And waited. Servers walked by every few moments, nobody stopped to fill our water glasses or take our order. Finally, we both said something to a girl who walked by. She seems mystified that there was a job to do. With that many people working, getting a cup of coffee shouldn't take 15 minutes. Yes. 15 freaking minutes.

Food? Mediocre at best. I got the traditional eggs benedict with home fries. The only saving grace with the amount of ham on it. The English muffin didn't seem to be toasted. The eggs were *ok* but nothing great. The home fries? My 9-year old niece could do a better job. My burps right now aren't even good enough to brag about.

I'm sure if the service had been better, I wouldn't be so miserable right now. My food coma isn't satisfying. I will *never* go here again. Ever. I felt stupid leaving a tip, it was THAT bad.

Looks like Oneplus is trying to go as the likes of Samsung, and Apple of being EXPENSIVE. Overall i liked the performance, it's crazy fast, 90hz refresh rate makes the overall experience much better. Charging is super fast but, but the camera could have been much better, day light photos are good but when you try to take videos with the wide angle camera, it crops the frame. Performance is top notch, display is only thing I bought this phone. Super sharp and crystal clear QHD+ Oled display gives an immersive experience while watching videos and Netflix content.

Pros:
1.The best thing about M30 is the performances where I didn't see any lag so far.
2.The amoled display at this price is an icing on the cake.
3.The battery life is one of biggest saver for heavy users like me.A fully charged M30 will last for one full day(HEAVY USERS)
4.Some of the camera pictures I shot with M30 awe some of my photography fraternity.I used to carry bulky DSLR for street photography,but I stopped doing that as I started relying much on M30 for candid street photography.
5.Android pie upgrades make the UI very easy.

Cons:
1.The biggest cons is the fast charging claims they made.After 1 month,I realised it takes more than 2 hours to fully charge.
2.The charging wire is too short which makes me think to purchase another adapter with lengthy wire.
3.This is not a beautiful looking phone compare to xiaomi and other mid range phones.

Also, their green and red sauce is a step above the competition, and they have great mexican rice, it comes with peas and carrots! Guac is exceptional, and they also have really tasty breakfast burritos that are available all day. Five stars for being consistent, clean and for having pleasant and professional employees! One more thing is that they close at midnight except for Sunday when they close at 10. Bummer but still the best!",2

I've been in AZ for 10 years now and I can say without a doubt that its some of the best food I've had in a restaurant (and this from a pregnant woman no less ;)

I had the fried chicken tenders, cheesy grits and fried okra. First, the food came out piping hot, I mean steaming and hot to the touch. The batter on the chicken was thick and crispy. The grits were cooked to perfection- dry enough to hold together a bit but still moist. And the okra was fantastic, too. It didn't hurt that my fresh lemonade came in a mason jar, either.

neutral,"What started as a food truck back in the 80s, has now evolved to two successful restaurants in the valley.  Using traditional recipes passed down through generations in Mexico - LT delivers the flavors that reminisce of street tacos in Mexico.  Using ingredients made from scratch, the marinades used for the various meats are outstanding!

Being first timers there, the service staff was very friendly and suggested what menu items we should try - to experience the best they had to offer.  Our number one dish was the #1 (about $6 or $7) - an assortment of three street tacos with chicken, pork, and beef.  All of them had unique and bold flavors - you could taste that the marinade had really absorbed into the meats.  They were served with cotija, pico, and cilantro - adding that truly authentic flavor to the tacos.  We also sampled the fish tacos and burritos.  

Why this wonderful little place does not receive four stars or more?  Despite what Guy Fieri said, despite the wonderful flavor of these tacos, everything we ate was lukewarm or less.  From the refried beans to the rice, to the taco meat, and burrito.  It gave us the sense that despite being made from scratch, these wonderful ingredients had been sitting there for a while.  Albeit the flavor and texture of the meats was grand, it did not taste fresh.",1

Finally spoke with the manager and had that sorted out but when I asked for our tables outside and they couldn't accommodate. 

Having the bartender wait on a party of 18 was idiotic. Not enough menus, slow, horrible drinks, no silverware, soup was burnt-how do you burn soup??? Attempting to fix the situation with beignets was a nice attempt until we heard the server swearing about having to deal with us. 

I host events all over the valley and never have I experienced service as horrible as I did at Metro. 

They have recently changed management, unfortunately the great reviews I read when I made the reservation don't hold true anymore.

Update 11/8/2010
Since my first review I received a $50 gift certificate from the management of Metro.  I decided to go for dessert last Friday night with 5 of my friends.  I knew I couldn't just go with one other person, it had to be a group to show what they could do.  

We arrived at 9:15 and were seated on the patio.  I met the general manager and she was pleasant enough, I never saw her again.  There was no one seated inside and the patio was half full.

Jesse greeted us and was the most attentive and understanding server when two guests needed to return their drinks to the bar because they were not made properly - it was a specialty drink from their cocktail menu.

We ordered beignets, apple bread pudding and triple chocolate delight.  The beignets and apple bread pudding were good.  The triple chocolate delight had absolutely no chocolate flavor at all.

Jesse was by far an excellent server and if you go ask to be seated in his section.",0

The screen was smashed on the fifth day of me purchasing this phone on it's very first fall! That's a shock. We have used phone which have  been dropped couple of times maximum damage was a dent, scratch or partial screen damage. This phone was completely damaged !!.
Thanks to acko insurance I could replace the screen- 4500rs.
Coming down to the phone- its pretty no doubt. Has a good screen resolution.
But the overall the phone is SUPER SLOW.
I am already thinking of updating to another phone before I drop it and the screen gets damaged !!!!",1
negative,"I ordered this phone on day 1 because I wanted to experience ""flagship"". Got this for 40k. So am using this phone for 4+ months.
The first time I got hands on this phone, it didn't feel very classy. One shouldn't pay more than 23-25k for such a phone.
Pros and cons mixed just as I think:
1) Screen flickers! Irritatingly so. Certain games such as ""push 'em all"" is not supported as screen begins flickering. YouTube also causes screen to flicker most of the time. Not everyone may be able to notice it but it does flicker, you can search videos about it on YoutTube.
2) OxygenOS has bugs with in-app Twitter browser, with its own Notes app and many others. I reported all within 2 days of buying the phone but forget fix, I didn't get a response either. These bugs were very irritating at first now I've somehow gotten used to those.
3) Camera is better than most android phones I've seen but Pixel and iPhone 11 beat this one, hands down.
4) Battery is average, lasts 24 hr. Good thing is the dash-charger - It's very impressive, charges in 60-65 mins from 0 to 100% and 0 to 70% in ~30 mins.
5) Night mode, Reading mode are also impressive and I feel the difference when compared to other Android phones.
6) Finger-print reader could have been better
7) Face unlock doesn't work in dark or even dim light. Even in lightness, our face needs to be in proper angle and a lazy face doesn't help unlock.
8) You need to buy a usb to 3.5mm jack cable separately.
9) Flash could have been better.
10) 8 GB RAM can be felt. It's fast. WiFi Calling, app installing, holding a network - all are very good.
11) Video calling in dim light/darkness could have been better. Way better.
12) Speakers are great. Ideal for music.
13) The gestures part is good. Makes a lot of functions easier and classier.
14) Haptic vibration is awesome.
15) I like how it asks for permission for everything and gives plenty of options regarding access to apps and carrier.
16) I use Glacier Blue and love that colour.

My lower rating is mostly because of OxygenOS bugs that I mentioned above and flickering. Also, within a month of launch they reduced prices drastically. So if you can deal with these cons and high price, go for it. Else buy K20 for lower budget and iPhone 11 for higher budget. Happy shopping!",0

Received on 3rd Oct 2019.
But
Not feeling good to use this MIA3 phone
purchased through Amazon. Every app keeps stopping again and again daily. Needs restarts many times. Network  disconnects various times. Often network signal totally closed.
Not supporting Excel files, PDF format etc which I have to use on daily basis.
Not happy at all with MIA3 purchased through Amazon.
Want to return it.
Today Phone stucked on switch on screen  for more than one hour just after 13 days of purchase #MIA3 Neither getting switched off nor restarted.
MI service centre Shastri Nagar Ratlam MP pin code 457001 was not helpful.
They told me they will update the software ( when it is not showing any new software update need in notifications) and that will lead to lose all my personal data e.g. contacts, photographs, music, files everything from my newly purchased MI A3 phone.
I don't want to keep this Phone.

I have to come out of my house to take a call.  I complaint regarding this to Samsung and their expertise on 18.02.2020.  with reference No.2267824599.  The expertise have advised me to re-set the system accordingly.  I reset the system with the help of expertise but the problem remained the same so far.

This problem came to know me when I purchased Oppo A5S phone for my wife.  It shows all the network full inside the house and network is working properly and also youtube is always ready, when it is on.

While my Samsung M30s does not do the same. That means there is some problem in my phone which I came to know after purchase of Oppo  A5S.",1
neutral,"First of all, if you are here for the CAMERA, I am sorry to tell you I dont give 2 cents to a camera, So this is not the place for stuff like that.
With that part out of the way, LET'S JUST JUMP INTO IT.
-----------------------------------------------------------
I have uploaded some AIDA64 snaps, take a look at it for specs.
Okay, if you are reading this review after all of that gargon I just puked you are most probably pretty well versed in technical stuff, so I will more emphasis on hardware rather than software as the latter can be seen from the snaps.

HARDWARE -
¤This is an all-plastic phone, so the first thing you should do is to rush and buy a screen guard and cover for this bugger, because this backplate I gonna have a lot of scratches.
¤TFT screen, the standard for budget phones.
¤The buttons feel clicky and do their job unexpectedly good.
¤5000mAh Li-Po battery, won't argue on how much it lasts as it depends on usage, but expect atleast 2-3 days if you are moderate user (subjective)
¤PRAISE THE ALL-MIGHTY, There is an headphone jack!!
¤The notch is kinda there, but you wont notice it that much (#dealwithit)
¤The face sensor is kinda slow, even on fast sensing, your best bet is fingerprint sensor, which is pretty good tbh.
¤GSM/HSPA/LTE network tech.
¤See the chipset, CPU, GPU from snaps.
¤Can't comment about thermals, as I do most of the heavy duty stuff on PC.
¤MONO SPEAKERS, YOU ARE WARNED!!

SOFTWARE -
¤#RemoveBloatware seriously, this phone gets loaded with couple of bloatware from the start, remove/disable them as per need. I personally have removed nearly all bloatware and installed my own substitutes in their place, sorry Samsung Max :p
¤The blue light filter is pretty bad, get a competitive one ASAP
¤The phone is pretty snappy, so no qualms there and you will most likely have 500-1000MB free RAM available at a time.
¤The pop-up multiscreens are pretty dope, especially useful in COV (chat over video) scenarios.
¤The 'Dolby Atmos' is surprisingly good, give it a try for yourself, almost makes me forgot them for putting MONO SPEAKERS!

Well, I don't feel like I can add anything to this review, will update it when I find something new.

Overall, I find this to be a good attempt by Samsung into the budget phone array, some gaping holes (MONO SPEAKERS), some gracious glories (HEADPHONE JACK), whether they can keep this momentum going or get fizzled out by established budget brands like Mi is story of another time.",1

negative,"I can overcome the hipster sneer and accept that I am an uncool blemish in a world full of cut-off corduroys and patterned leggings. What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.

I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, ""well we don't have anymore of that one.""

Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. I'm over you being cooler than me, but I'm not over you having no soul.",0

I am skeptical as to how well the condiment bar looks in good light, which may explain the choice of lighting. Still, grinning and bearing it, I load up my veggie burger with appropriate toppings and, usually with fried zucchini in hand make my way to one of the very uncomfortable seats.

Every time I go to the Chuck Box I feel as if there is going to be something wrong with the food, and this something is being concealed from me by the lack of lighting. Yet, each time I go I have a delicious veggie burger or grilled chicken sandwich. My friends have also enjoyed ""real"" burgers there as well.

Technically how can a software decide the physical heat while am feeling the heat , how can they deny even though am in return policy period ???

It hangs abruptly and every now and then it lags. Battery life is good but if you expect Samsung to deliver you a premium product then don't fool yourself.

Looks like I'll have to go back for a carne asada burrito, but based on the size I saw (and what I've read), it's gonna have to be a one item meal!  They're huge!  I tried the street tacos to sample a few things...carnitas, pollo and pescado.  All excellent.  I would have to lean to the carnitas though.  Definately going back!

Only reason it didn't get 5 stars is there was a kid sweeping and mopping the floor and we were having to get out of his was several times.  Just kinda rubbed me wrong.

Do buy it when it's available for ₹34999 with UAG case to protect your phone. I have no idea and trust on other cases to protect Oneplus 7T as the back panel is made of glass (you can refer to durability tests on YouTube, to get an Idea about what I'm trying to say about the protection).

positive,"Value for money: Truly a value for money phone, as in this range you are getting everything you need.

Handiness: Great confidence on hold, I have always used phones without back covers and tempered glass. When I was buying this phone was thinking how will I manage this big phone but I was surprised as it is not slippery with a glass-like material which keeps your look on.

Camera: Great camera, I am not much mobile camera freak but when I used it I found it extremely great in the range.

Battery: It is fine, stays for 1.5 or 2 days was expecting it will last for more time but it is fine as there are many services which are continuously running so it's fine. And I was thinking that with 6000 mah battery it will be heavy but it's not as compared to other phones.

Sound: Quality of sound is very good whether it is speaker phone or as you can play music aswell and it's enough for a small room.

Screen: It is good, as it's a display and picture quality is great it shows real colours.

Backside: I liked this new material by Samsung which is used in the backside of this phone, as when you hold your phone, you will not feel it slippery and in this range it is great, the only thing I felt is it's backside cover quickly captures the dirt of hand and drops handprints etc.",2

3. SP 855 Processor is blazing fast. No lag at all.

1. No 3.5 mm Port and Dongle is not provided. So a BIG ZERO to ONEPLUS TEAM for that.

I really enjoyed it here, but there's too much freakin broken glass on any of the trails down near the main shade/view structure that you should realy avoid it if you have your dogs with you and stick to the more wilderness areas.

30 other reviews = TLDR (i just learned that one, see how I'm applying) so I'd rather be brief and useful than wordy and redundant.

I did read Chuck R's review, and I have to say, I wish I knew more of the nooks and crannys that you do, but I can tell you that if you want to explore the Western reaches of the park, do so by starting in the center or east, and not to bother with approaching from the West side of the mountain range itself.  All you'll find out there is a bunch of paranoid, possesive property owners who didn't stop to think that if they chose to own a home on a ribbon of private land that surrounds public land and restricts the public from getting to their public land, then they'll have to endure a little bit of traffic from said public.  Here's a clue for any of those property owners, whether you're on South Mountain, Piestewa, wherever....the guy sneaking around is the one you call the cops on for being a suspicious trespasser, not the guy driving a family suv with 2 dogs in the back, who calls you from the street as he sees you in your driveway so he can ask directions on how to get to the park entrance so he doesn't have to bother you nice people in the residential neighborhood anymore driving around here.    ah, duh.",2

positive,"The experience with the OnePlus 7T is simply smooth and flawless. OnePlus have realised the difference a 90Hz panel makes, which is why they are including it on all their products. And you have to use it to believe it, a screen with 90Hz refresh rate is truly a joy to use (undoubtedly my favourite part of the phone). Coming to battery life, it easily lasts a day and a half for my usage but my usage is not that heavy. I only have to plug it in for 40 mins every morning before I go to work, nothing else ( charging speeds are INSANE). Lastly, as a person who is coming from a phone that was in a much lower price segment, I find the cameras to be more than adequate. However, if you truly want that top of the line camera experience, you may have to look at other flagships. We also know how quick and reliable OnePlus are with software updates and that is yet another great positive with this device. All in all, for 38K, I feel like OnePlus hit the nail on the head with this one. The phone is so slick and a joy to use on a day to day basis and comes with more or less all the bells and whistles you need.

positive,"I usually don't review chain restaurants since I don't want everyone to know that I eat at them...but I have to give a shout to this location of McCormick's!  We were in Phoenix for a quick weekend and I had neglected to do any Yelp research before leaving, so when my bf found M&S from the concierge we decided to give it a go.  We had been disappointed with our last experience at the one in Dallas so I was mainly just hoping to have my hunger satiated so I could go to bed.

I was very pleasantly surprised.  We were hungry so ordered what felt like tons of food (don't judge!).  The mussels and bruschetta to start were great!  The mussels were small, the way I like them, and the sauce/broth/bread soak they were in was amazing.  I had the halibut stuffed with a bunch of stuff as suggested by our server, bf had the dover sole, both were good, but that dover sole was amazing!!!!  very light and perfectly cooked.  I wish I could cook fish like that.

We finished with some kind of passionfruit mousse dessert that was SO good.  I almost took another one to go.

The service was great.  I would go back to this M&S location anytime I was in town.",2

Sabatinos is Closed
You know we have been experiencing a lack of sales which we can blame on the economy, new restaurants opening here in the valley (most likely for much less cost than us original places), we tried to work with our landlord, but he would not budge on lowering our rent. We just could not afford the 5500.00 this month and were afraid we would lose everything in our place to a Lockout, which was threatened to us already.
We just wanted to say goodbye to all of our loyal customers, we really enjoyed having you come in weekly and keeping up with your lives as well as you keeping up with ours. We will probably be leaving the Az area and starting over fresh.

positive,"Good food in a unique setting with fantastic service.  Nobou at Teeter House offers up a very pleasurable dining experience.

I'll start with the great.  The restaurant is in a more than 100-year-old house in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  There is nearly a perfect feeling that I have been invited inside someone's home for a fancy dinner party.  The staff was fantastic.  Our server, Alexis, was very attentive, friendly, fast, and really knew the menu (or at least was good at selling every dish with a very thorough description about the technique and flavors used to create it).  The presentation of the food is creative and beautiful. 

The not-so-great.  The food is served in small portions at a high price.  I wouldn't have a big problem with that, I actually think Americans should be more into tapas eating, except nothing we ordered blew my mind or taste buds away.  Don't get me wrong; everything we ordered was excellent.  The food is perfectly cooked, seasoned, sauced, and artistically plated.  It just didn't have that over-the-top ""WOW"" factor I was hoping for.

Having said that.  Nobuo at Teeter House is still a place that everyone should try out at least once.  It's an enjoyable place to eat.  It's probably a fun place to go with a small group of friends just to hang out, order a lot of plates and just sample what the restaurant has to offer.

As I said, the price can be a little high.  It took five plates and a dessert to create a fair size meal for just two people.  That came to nearly a $100 tab (with drinks).  But Nobuo at Teeter House is on Local Dines (http://www.localdines.com/?ref=19485) with a $50 or $25 gift certificate.  Take advantage of the deal and cross Nobuo off your Phoenix restaurant bucket list.",2

There is lot of content on internet stating that A3's display is no good. But in my opinion its display is decent enoungh. No one one would zoom into the display to see it's pixels. The cameras are great . Battery life could have been a bit better because of the 720p display but it is still managable. Only thing that I miss is a fast finger print scanner. But as my time is not that important that some seconds would matter so I got used to it easily.
And above all it's android one device and that makes it more snappy.
The pricing is also lucrative.

negative,"This MI A2 is worst phone i ever used for following reasons.
1. This phone has Low battery life. The company claim it to last at least one day but trust me the battery for new phone lasts not longer then 12 hours while using. Every night you sleep with alarm in your phone but you will wake up with switched off phone.
2. There is no earphone jack. It means you can not talk on your phone using earphones and charger at the same time. Given the low battery life you need to apply charger more then your earphones. It is a bigest inconvenience in this phone. (PS..I didnt receive Any cable to connect phone with earphone so it caused me a higher inconvenience.)
3. The screen brightness  is very low evenif you set at highest. It is very difficult to use it in Bright Day light. You have to find shade if you want to comfortably use the screen.
4. You can not return this mobile because amazon will not let you do so. They claim 10 days return but this claim is a fake claim because when you go to return page of amazon website,it will make you talk to customer case. Customer care executive  will pressure you to apply for home visit of expert for mobile inspection for any fault. No eperson will come to visit you And you will end up biting your anger. (It is my latest experience)

Conclusion is that.. If you r looking for a convenient and user friendly mobile withgood camera then dont go with this product . Only go if you want to buy a camera with stupid mobile features.

positive,"I'm more of a laptop person, but wanted a good phone and i think i got it. This review is after usage of 15 days.
So, this one's going to be in different points:
1.) Display: 90 Hz is really good if you spend a lot of your time in your phone. If you keep on 90 Hz you will get even less than average battery life. I recommend turning on 90 Hz only when you are doing something which needs great display quality.
2.) Battery: It's the only con i could find in this great phone. BUT,BUT,BUT, the charger makes up around 90% of this less battery life issue. You can get full charge from 0 in at max 70 minutes. To summarize, you can go for it if you have a desk job.
3.) Performance: It's pretty fast. As fast as any reasonable person would need. Truth is this is a 35k phone, so the performance you get is definitely worth 50k. Don't compare it with phones which are above 80k or 90k. If you do that, you're just a badgering person.
4.) Camera: Not really a camera freak, but it's really good. You get all the details you want and expect from a cell phone. IF YOU ARE A SELF-CERTIFIED CAMERA ENTHUSIAST, BUY A DSLR. Nobody's stopping you from that. Don't hope a phone will give you the world's best camera.

2. Now I come to its battery it has 6000 mah of battery life,which lasts a long ,in my recent days I watch movies,playing games but it doesn't last.
3. Now about its look, very attractive especially it's back with superb camera design .I impressed.

neutral,"Ahhh... Zinc.  It's been a while since I have left Paris.  Being a resident and citizen there for so long, I would like to think I can spot a decent French fare.  I have now been to Zinc three times, every time I ordered something different, so far the food has not dissapointed as much as the prices have.  Wow.

Okay, okay, you have a spot in Scottdale, it's a nice little posh area with plenty of traffic, designer furniture and nick-nack and artsy stores that typically have things that would require your to take out a 2nd mortgage to afford those things that often just gather dust, one season at a time at home.  You would think someone on that strip would be the one to say, let's have reasonable prices.  Zinc is not one of those.

The restaurant has the name Bistro in it. They have folks dining out on the sidewalk, dining with noise and the occasional smell of BMW exausts...  That's beautiful and very Parisian, also very Bistro.  Here is a wake up call though... Bistros offer fares with decent prices, a prix fixe menu and simply good simple food.  

The prices were incredibly high for what you do get.  Unfortunately the charm of having an outdoor patio and serving fries in fake newspaper doesn't cut it.    The Steak Frites (a hanger steak w/ fries and a brandy sauce) is a French Bistro Classic, a staple if you will and that was the only thing that was fairly prices for what you get.  But if you knew how much those cuts are to get from a supplier, you'd be asking questions about the prices even then.

On two of those occasions we had cheese plates, it was more of a mix and match, you could pick from a few Chevres, Softs and hard cheeses,  they were incredibly small portions but the breads that came with the platter was very tasty, warm and fresh.  It is typically served with a ramkin of olives.

So overall, sounds like I am bashing this restaurant, I am not but I am dieing to find a reason to go back because there is something good about it, the atmosphere, the lighting, the seasonal menu.  But little things keep me from enjoying Zinc.  Such as the time we sat at the secluded back part of the restaurant, the small courtyard.  Very charming, though some of the waiters, and cooks smoked right outside of the courtyard's gates.  The smell of cheap cigarettes and mumbled chatter caused us to ask for another table, when we did, we were all the sudden looked as ""picky customers"".  

One more tip Zinc, you may want to get the mall janitor to move his trash can from the view of your utmost beatiful courtyard, such promise, undelivered due to tacky flaws that could have been prevented by an attentive manager or even a caring waite staff.

Don't miss:  Dining in the courtyard, or the sidewalk.

Located in what seems to be the World's Largest Strip Mall With Confusing Parking Lot, this is a very low-key enjoyable place.  It was not at all crowded on this particular afternoon, and as an added bonus, pints were Sunday bargain-priced at $3!  I tried my first ever Dirty Pear (Guinness on top of Ace Pear Cider) - dangerously good.  I wonder if it can be counted as a serving of fruit...

You can't have an Irish bar without fish & chips, and theirs is pretty good - a large slab of lightly-battered fish which was more than enough for sharing, served with a stack of crisp french fries.  While I prefer thick-cut steak fries, these skinny ones were consumed with no problem whatsoever!

I went to the Valley Ho on an amazing business trip that involved rock stars and the Oakland Athletics, which happen to be my favorite team. it was downright magical. 

the decor was fantastic, the rooms were huge, with huge tubs, a poolside patio and a comfy chaise lounge. the flatscreen TV had an iPod doc! yaaaaay! (why don't more hotels do this?) 

the pool was phenomenal. i sat around for days on couches drinking bloody mary's and frozen drinks. the lobby bar had a deadly but wonderful drink called the stardust. 

The trader vic's attached isn't so hot, but i generally liked all the food i got from the pool bar and the restaurant ZuZus. (room service too- they make their own english muffins!!!)

If i'm comparing it to the royal palms, the other phoenix resort i raved about, it's tough. Royal Palms is better for chilling and families; Valley Ho is better for singles. Royal Palms is your wedding; Valley Ho the bachelorette party. Valley Ho had better food and more style, but Royal Palms had a bit more to it and better service. Really, you can't go wrong with either.

positive,"Why did I wait so long to try this neighborhood hot spot!  Having a father who grew up on Los Olivos I remained a loyal customer, that is, until last evening's change in plans lured me to the colorfully lit and lively patio of Los Sombreros Authentic Mexican Cafe & Cantina.  I am not an expert on ""authentic"" Mexican cuisine nor will I pretend to know what  the flavors of San Miguel de Allende taste like; however, I am a foodie so I know good food when I eat it.  

We chose to sit outdoor and enjoy the beautiful weather while taking in another Cardinal's loss!  (Sad, I know, since they were off to a great start)....  Lucky for us it was a calm Monday night and we had the full attention of our waiter, aka the bartender.  Phil (no need to blush if you read this) did a wonderful job walking us through their many margarita selections while also conveying his personal favorites that showcased his love for whiskey!  My friend allowed Phil to make his margarita as he felt a fine margarita should be made while I allowed Phil to concoct my special margarita while following strict no sugar, no salt, heavy on the tequila preferences...and that was just to start!  Perfectly crafted margaritas in hand, check.  Now what to eat for dinner.  

My friend ordered his beloved Mole poblano ($18.95) while I couldn't decide between the Smoked chicken enchiladas with salsa verde and chipotle crema (yumm) and the Pollo a la parilla with spinach in a chipotle cream sauce -or- tinga Poblana sauce($18.95).  I opted for the Pollo a la parilla with chipotle cream preparation and, once again, my dinner friend had 'order envy'!!  That's not to say his Mole was par (or dare I say sub-par) because it wasn't - it actually has received many culinary awards being named ""Best Mole"" both locally and nationally, but because the chipotle cream sauce combined with spinach, perfectly sautéed  chicken breasts and a side of warm corn tortilla is....AMAZZZZZZING!!!!  It's also fair that I note aside from the pricier entree dishes served w two sides (as we ordered), they also offer up tacos (3 at $10.95), various quesadillas (@ $5.95) and other lesser priced authentic eats including fresh guacamole, salads and more!  

Deciding I'd save room to see if they could satisfy my sweet tooth I boxed my remaining dinner as we read through each and every dessert.  Undecided, again, and so we trusted our gastronomy guide, Phil, to choose.  He selected the Mexican Chocolate Cream Pie to finish off the evening, and we happily finished off this delectable treat leaving one bite as I always like to do!!!   

Thank you, Phil and Los Sombreros, for the memorable dining experience.  The food was outstanding, margaritas made by Phil are the best, and the patio alone is enough to draw me back for HH or even a late night dessert.  Thank you for staying in the neighborhood, Azucena Tovar, and congrats on almost turning 20 years old.",2

The store is mapped out and sectioned nicely too. Finding things is easy, and if you can't (or don't want to) the very friendly staff are there to help. It looks like they employ people who know a thing or two about the supplements also... so whether you are looking for: digestive health, immune support, weight loss, muscle building, herbs, beauty or whatever; they have it, and they can tell you about it! Pretty Good! 

You can even get a customer rewards card and build up bonus points to get discounts and stuff. And they can track your purchases with it should you ever (like me) loose your receipt!

What I am really impressed with though is their customer service and return policy. I did not expect them to accept a return and refund my money on 2 items that I purchased there because I lost the receipt. Especially, since I did not purchase it on a member card so they could not track my purchase either. I thought I would try my luck with it anyway and was hoping for an exchange. Well, the clerk was so nice to me. She said that it was no problem and would gladly refund my money (I didn't even ask for a refund)... and I had opened one product. I was speechless and felt a little guilty about it too - since it was almost a month that had passed (I really didn't think they'd take them back). Anyway, I told her that an exchange would be more than appreciated, and she said, ""No problem:-)"" again! So I very guiltily walked over to get some of the items I needed. They had them and they had them on sale - cheaper than I have ever seen and in more of a selection too. 

Needless to say, I walked out of there very happy (but feeling a bit undeserving). But that is what good - EXCELLENT - customer service is all about - exceeding the customer's expectations! 

This I my new store for all of my supplements and health & wellness needs. I recommend checking them out. They seem to have everything one could ever need. Plus, they have an entire wall (and more) dedicated to muscle, weight and fitness - if that is your thing! Also be sure to check out their website; they even have customer reviews & ratings! and product information/facts and ingredients. Really Cool!",2

I like it spicy.  Interpret that as you wish, but when it comes down to it -- it takes a lot more than spicy pickles to impress me - say gigantic and decadent choco chip cookies. Don't let the gimmicky name fool you, however, these are some serious sandwiches at Spicy Pickle, a franchise with only one location in the Valley in Chandler.  I found the quality of food and scope of sandwiches offered to be comparable to Dilly's Deli. 

I had a lunch earlier this week catered from this place, and since they catered half-sized portions I was able to try two: the Santa Cruz sub and wiseguy sub.

I found the wiseguy (with italian meats and cheeses) sub to be pretty tasty, but I prefer my subs to not swim in oil and vinegar.  The Santa Cruz sub was pretty good though (and my favorite of the two) - with its ingredients of Mesquite turkey, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, corn relish, cheddar and chipotle mayo.

The highlight of the lunch were these large thick discs that looked and tasted like chocolate chip cookies.  Crispy on the edges and moist and soft in the middle.  Seriously, one of the better cookies I have had in a long time.

BTW, the pickles are sprinkled with some kind of chili powder and are ok, perhaps they're awesome -- I don't know, I'm not a big pickle fan.",2

It's the start of the Mormon Loop and when you connect up to the Mormon Trail/National Trail it extends the hike to about 4 or so miles.  Or at least that's what I have been telling myself.  First part is stair master-esque, then descends very gradually (perfect place to add a run into your hike), then ascends again (catch your breathe) and then gets a bit boulder-y and you can either straight up hike this or run.  If you want, you can take the offshoot to Hidden Valley and Fat Man's Pass.  I wasn't too impressed with either, but it is definitely worth a view and will spit you back out onto the National Trail.",2

The most delicious thing I have ever eaten in my whole life was actually a rose macaroon.

If you need an emergency vet in the Scottsdale/Paradise Valley area, go to Sonora Veterinary Specialists on Cactus/40th St.(http://www.sonoraveterinaryspecialists.com/). It's also 24/7, but unlike VCA PVEAH, it is a truly valuable, legitimate facility, and it''s staffed by engaged, committed, deeply caring, and extremely knowledgeable and skilled personnel. At SVS, you and your pet are treated well and what you pay is fair and justified.

VCA is the opposite of SVS in every single way. VCA is, in fact, the WORST of corporate animal service providers. The space is small, cheap, cramped, and the staff are indifferent at best and don't convey any genuine love of or concern about animals in pain or distress. All they want is your money. They do NOTHING for the $99.75 they charge for an ""emergency exam."" We essentially paid that amount just to be given an astronomical estimate, literally nothing more--our dog was the exact same bloody, traumatized mess we gave to them when they gave him back--after making us wait nearly an hour without ANY communication).  Furthermore, they tack on bogus surcharges ($5.25 for a ""biohazard waste fee"") that are irrelevant to the ""service"" provided, and their drug prices are absurd--$8 for a single Tramadol tablet, anyone?

Conversely, our (and our dog's) experience at Sonora Veterinary Specialists was wonderful (even in the context of an emergency), and the cost was ultimately significantly less.

VCA is a money-grubbing, depressing, sham.",0

Everything from the food to the coffee is first rate!

 I love the yogurt and granola parfait (strawberry and vanilla yogurt for me with a bit of honey and light granola) for breakfast with a white chocolate latte. Also, the breakfast burritos are perfectly creative and filling. For lunch, my favorite is the cactus club panini with a small side salad.
 Also worth mentioning is that they have the VERY BEST iced coffee around. They call it an iced toddy and any one of the employees would be happy to tell you how it is different from regular coffee. I just know that it tastes amazing and seems to have a bit more of a caffeine kick!
  My favorite part about Press are their delectable desserts! The berry mascarpone cake pretty much makes you feel like you've won the lottery. And the ghirardelli brownies and chocolate chip cookies (warmed up) are a weekly addiction of mine.

negative,"Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made.
Cons:
1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common.

2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless.

3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease.

Pros:
1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light.

2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open.

3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.",0

positive,"Over the last 15 years of using phones, I have spent a good part of my last decade- life & earnings on IPhones.  Except for Iphone 5, I’ve had all models until my last one which was the Iphone 8plus.  There was a brief period when Samsung (S6) grabbed my attention and it served me well, however the bloatware got the best of me before I switched back to IOS.

Iphone 8 Plus was with me for over 18 months and the charm had worn off-  it had started slowing down to a point where one could really notice it.  I know,  change the battery, do a factory reset & get another 18 months out of it, but I was just too lazy to do all of that. Spending lots of money on a new Iphone when there was nothing new on offer did not make sense for me.  Specifically, the option of only face unlock and even worse was the speed of unlocking the phone.  After playing around from various phones within friends & family:

Enter One plus 7T-

Pros:
- Premium build & exudes quality.  I got the Blue version
- Charging speed-  It’s a miracle!!  ~30% to 100% by the time I finish my shower & breakfast
- Speed-  Multi tasking is a joy,  never had a single instance of phone hanging or an app crashing (Side note- Android apps have really become stable from 5 years ago)
- Screen is really impressive- Bright, vivid & I love the color saturation (this is a personal choice)
- Dual sim-  now I carry just one phone
- Connectivity- Wifi & Mobile Network are better than I experienced on my older 8Plus
- Camera-  Debatable, they are not the best nor the worst.  Colors can appear unnatural at times.  I prefer Iphone 11 on this one, but much better than Samsung S9 or older Iphones
- Customization options are unlimited-  Fancy for me
-  In screen Fingerprint scanner - as fast as any normal one

Cons:
- Battery-  Let’s be clear.  I am a heavy user with office mails synced on phone.  This lasts the work day, but I won’t be confident to go out for tipple after work without a short boost.  But this was the case with my 8 Plus too, except I now need just 15 mins to charge and not an hour like before.  Not a deal breaker for me
- Battery-  Update after few days of usage.  Switch to 60hz display, turn off wifi/BT when not in use and it actually lasts much longer.  But 60Hz is not fun once you have used 90Hz
- No 3.5 mm, but they could’ve given the convertor
- It’s a pain to get tempered glass or back cover from local shops.  Guess this will change soon with more phones coming to the market",2

I had a groupon so Laura A. and I went to try out this amazing place.  The groupon got us each two scoops so we went with 4 different so we could sample the most possible.  I got the Apple Pie / Spiced Rum and Black Raspberry / Chambord Liqueur.  Both were awesome I actually enjoyed the Chambord the most but I was in ice cream heaven.  

Laura got the Mimosa with Champagne and the Margarita / Tequila.  I really enjoyed both of her's the margarita was a strawberry one which is my fav.  The Mimosa was very refreshing and I could imagine that being a great hangover remedy at about 11am on a Saturday =) just sayin.  

I have found a new place to cure my sweet cravings and can't wait to try more flavors as the website has many more I didn't see in store so I assume they are on rotation which is great.

negative,"Here's my personal take on the new OnePlus 7T - Most of the reviews here is positive and yes it's probably a decent phone but unfortunately it didn't work out for me.

I had couple of major problems with this - Overheating and battery discharge. I have been with the OnePlus ecosystem since their 3 model. The last one I had was 5. And it's very very hard to beat that edition. Probably I had higher expectations from 7T. The phone overheats while you're on a video call. It shoots up to 48-50 degrees and simultaneously discharges faster than Samsung. I have reduced the refresh rate, removed the animations, live wallpaper - still it's very mediocre.

Just comparing with my OnePlus 5, it didn't feel like an update that's worth. The camera was never OnePlus's strong point and it remains with 7t. It's average at its best.

The phone's generic performance is fluid as expected, but the flaws above didn't make the cut. I have returned mine and decided to go with something else.

Cheers to those who liked this phone.",0

The door to the rooms open to the outside, which is not typical of a Hampton Inn. I was concerned to stay in such a hotel at first since I am a woman traveling alone.  The area is ok, and the hotel area seems to be pretty safe and well lit. The lobby and pool area are very pretty, but again...the doors open to the outside so when I was positioned right near the pool, I could hear everything that went on.  The bed was standard Hampton Inn bed (comfy) but the room was small.  My biggest complaint, by far, is how bad the noise carries.  I'm still sitting in the room and I can hear the entire conversation going on next door...I can make out every single word.  Additionally, I can hear the person upstairs.  Their sound insulation is terrible.  There is a gap around my door (and remember, it opens to the outside) so can hear everything that goes on outside, too.  They've done a nice job of spiffying it up, but I did not find it to be appropriate for a business traveler.",0

positive,"First of all, those people who have given the 1 and 2 star reviews either don't know how to appreciate a device's worth or are not able to recognise the qualities of this device.

Okay, so i have used this device for more than a week, and all i want to say is this device is really worth every penny.
I'll list down the pros and cons now:

Pros:
1) This monster battery of 5000mAh can power you through 2 days no doubt.
2) Considering that Amoled display is absent, it still is on par with it and you'll not be disappointed with display for sure.
3) The USB-C type Adaptive fast charger is really a beast. It charges the phone really, really quickly.
4) The Face ID and Fingerprint sensors are very responsive.
5) The new Samsung experience UI is very well optimised, very responsive and you'll not face any lag whatsoever.
6) The In-Built Dolby Atmos lets you adjust the quality of your output sound in several ways.
7) The design of this device really feels premium and handles well.
8) Lastly, the gaming performance is good if not the best. All those negative reviews saying it can't run PUBG; it lags during the game, etc. can't possibly be true. I've played PUBG on the Balanced setting and runs very smoothly, no noticeable frame drops or lag. Although if you want to play on HD settings you might get a tad bit of frame drops, and yes it does heat up near the camera region but it is non-existent to me since i have a back cover LOL.

Cons:
1) The cameras. They're not upto the mark i'd say. Though they have inserted the new Wide-angle feature in cameras, i still don't feel as if the photos are good.
2) It's quite heavy, but considering it's huge battery and display, that is inevitable.
3) The fingerprint sensor is placed a bit higher on backside that makes it a little hard to reach.
4) The Aspect ratio. Whenever i have to watch a video on youtube or chrome, the notch area and navigation bar area are not fully covered. Although you can enable the fullscreen mode on these apps, it doesn't help since the video gets cropped significantly. I'd like to know a workaround for that.

Apart from these cons the device is really the BEST in this price range. Also considering this is a Samsung device, you can rest assured that this is bound to last long unlike the other Chinese smartphones (lol you know which ones i'm talking abt).

Hope I helped!",2

negative,"I'm not that aware of the technical things in deep, but here's what i observed in a week's usage.

1. Handy
This is not a fat junky mobile, i had Galaxy S7 earlier, this is a bit bigger but easy to operate on one hand

2.Speakers
Very loud, Very good

3. Camera
Decent, AI camera is good, 48 mega pixel is only in Pro Mode. Lens is a bit wide, better than one plus 6 (not used other one plus phones)

5. Memory and Storage
Good enough for me. Phone never hangs, I frequently use google maps and android auto together and was very smooth, infact smoother than Galaxy s7. Job well done by processor and RAM

6. Battery
Decent, got close to 40 hours on medium usage. I dont play high end games, I use for browsing, navigation, entertainment

7. Looks/Weight
Looks neat and clean, Little heavy but very well built body

8. Others
I liked the feature of guest accounts, you can add as many as guest accounts and as many as Whatsapp accounts in each of them.

Finger print sensor is a bit slow at times, but facelock was good. As I have work profile, I always prefer screenlock (my job is a little sensitive doesn't want to expose anything and be in trouble)

There are other good features like limiting phone usage, monitoring usage etc. Overall pretty nice phone. Better than other Mi phones as this one is loaded with a clean OS. I would say best midrange phone. (I selected thois over Moto one Action, Realme XT, Sammsung A50)

positive,"Pros:
1.Battery 6000 mAh- good to last for 2 days with moderate use. (I am not a gamer)
2. Camera- good at day light shots(front & back). Definitely need improvement at low light conditions. Same camera performes better than this at Realme& Redmi.
3.Display- Super Amoled- best
4. It does not feel too heavy even though with 6000 mAh battery.
5. Android 10- Samsung's One UI2. Latest with great GUI.
6. Finger print sensor- fast with great response.
Cons:
1.Exynos 9611 processor - average. Not meant for gamers.
2. Plastic back.
3. Charging- ~2.5 hrs to fuel the battery ful
4.Focus hunting- While recording video camera struggles to focus. You feel it only when viewed on big screens.",2

negative,"Music was loud as shit.  The food, Jesus Christ the food.  Lame ass chips and salsa.  No joke, like 8 chips were on the plate.  Salsa was probably one of the worst I've had, no flavor at all and warm.   Salads come out warm (I'm assuming this is why I've been puking).  Gross right, warm lettuce.  Waiter let's us know they can make daughter a little quesadilla (cheese only) which comes out so greasy.  Our taco plates come out 10 minutes later.  2 dinky tacos on each plate that are flavorless and luke warm at best.  Yes, they are spicey, no that does not mean they are flavorful.  I'm literally using my cell phone to see what was on the plate it's so dark.  Mint water was warm.  Gross and not refreshing whatsoever.  My daughter's quesadilla was $13, yes for 2 tortillas smaller than my hand and some 'cheese'.  I get it- make a dollar, but damn, don't rip your customers off.  So over the top lame.  Neither my husband nor myself finished.   Meal was $46.  Horrible.  Health department should go temp that place- I'm not sure the refrigeration is working properly.

positive,"I can only add my gushing praise to the other reviews.  Not only is the food outstanding (pork osso bucco, green chile stew and pecan/fig pie), but the ambiance and service really help make this place a standout.  So many places have arrogant, stuffy service, so Scottsdale.  Not so here.  Also, the waitstaff had opinions about the food - which dishes are his favorite and why.  Elegant but comfortable atmosphere, reasonable prices, and a real enthusiasm from the staff (and a chef, who came to visit with folks that he knew who were sitting near us).  The food is rich, but did not seem unhealthily so - not bathed in salt and heavy cream sauce.  Perfect portion size, with a balance - meat, grains and veggies.  So happy that Beckett's is in the neighborhood!

The menu has a nice selection of rolls and other dishes, and they're good, just not...great. We had a couple different specialty rolls, a tofu dish, soft shell crab, and tempura. Overall it was fresh and well-presented and halfway between actually authentic Japanese and some American Asian fusion food. The bar is crowded if you grab drinks while waiting and the bartenders weren't really fabulous in any way. Same goes for the servers who lack attentiveness and decorum in general. For a place with such a wait, huge crowds, and pretentious hostesses, I'd expect a little more. The curved booths along the sides are nice, though.

We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican, which we are not complaining about in the least, but it was time for something different. Our neighbor recommended Richardson's/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night.

We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner. My fiancé ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal. Hurrah! We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms. One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven. They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces. You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical.

My fiancé ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper. I'm not a steak lover, but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth. Fantastic. I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite! 

What did it for me, however, was the dessert. We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries. The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy. Very memorable. We will be back, even if it's just for the truffles!",2

The phone can handle itself well i did not face any lag of frame drops. There was heating but if you play on max setting of any phone for long hours you will face heating. The battery was amazing it lasted for 8 hrs (6hrs of high setting which left it at 5 percentage and the 2 hours of mild usage) i wiuld say the prosessor has to do a lot with powersaving as it ment for performance and saving. The wide angle camare still needs work mainly at low light image does come dark but ofcourse that some you will only notice if you do a comparison.
Haptic has modes high is the best you feel life something is ticking you in the pocket when you are riding or driving. The audio was a high inprovement after the update now i can hear it from the other room. :)  There are cons like if you are swiping very fast if will detect a tocuh anywhere on the screen also when i placed my earphones on it the phone went crazy ( sadly it managed to uninstall Pubg and all i could do was watch as all my data went down the drain) but that fine i installed it again.
The call quality ti good i can hear what people are saying and people can hear what i am saying so no problem there. Internet speed now that really depends on how far the tower is fron you, you will face really slow speeds.  my airtel is the worst
With speed from very good to worst.
1) jio/vodaphone. Both sims have 4g active at once. So you you turn on inter on one the other won't goto 3g.
2) idea tho it's part of voda now but not as good as voda
3) airtel.
The download speeds for jio are at 2 mb/s that what i got when i was downloading from plastore speedtest showed 10mb/s i did get 10 mb/s but after 3 to 6 am when network traffic is reduced. With voda i got 800 kb/s to 2mb/s it staded at 2mb for the most part but there were drops way more the jio.
Ideo had 600kb/s  to 1mb/s that was the best i got from it.
Now it's airtel with 160 kb/s to 400kb/s
I was able to download buy hugh files i was just sitting and watching thr screen.
You have to keep in mind this is in my area it may be defferent in your area.

I hope this helps i will try to update of any changes.",2

I saw some purple color dots appear on the right side corner of the phone after 10days and it gets increased within 10 days and now the full display got scrambled... I went to customer service and requested the reason, they are saying it is because of internal pressure. I really don't know what was that... Also, I don't have any method to give internal pressure to a phone... And they were saying it will not come under warranty, I am surprised 😲 about that... I haven't used the phone for one month completely... And I am really upset the way supervisors and customer service agents explained the issue and warranty terms...

I do believe in second chances and they won me over.  I don't get the mushroom on the Kobe; Meat is very tasty and flavorful, no need to add any toppings.  The Samburger and Zinburger are very tasty as well.  Last time I added bacon to the Zinburger, very good, and I do recommend that.  The staff are very attentive to diners needs.

*Look is okay.
*Samsung gives quality product so it will work for years.
*Battery is really good, comes with type c charger so fast charging is available
Bad points-
*initially finger print sensor worked really well now it does not even sometimes I have to type my password instead of using fingerprint.
*I personally feel display doesn't work that good.
*not good for gaming at all, initially pubg was playing OKAY but now it hangs and I don't feel like playing it at all , so if you are a gamer I would say a big NO.
*it was initially fine but now it hangs a lot bcz of pubg taking too much space of RAM or may be bcz it is one of the features that come with Samsung, if you are a gamer I think you should go for mi.

I had the smothered chicken and regretted it immensely - fried chicken covered with gravy amounts to a mess of watery breading.  Between that and having to dig through the mess to find the bones, it wasn't exactly a lot of meat down my throat.  Mac & Cheese and white rice as my sides were good.

The ambiance?  There IS none.  I found more entertainment from the writing on the wall, which had clearly been painted over MANY times since the 60s, and the open/close sign which reads, if closed, to contact ""Jesus"".  LOL.

Unaware of the church across the street, I arrived right after Sunday services to find the place fairly full - some churchgoers, at least one newcomer party, and several regulars.  Based on the caloric content of the entrees, I wasn't surprised to see about 50% obese customers, while the rest were inexplicably thin.

As a Whitey, I can't say that I was comfortable.  Clientele is almost all Black and while they are some of my best friends, I only felt welcome because of the cordial words spoken by our waiter and the cashier at the checkout, who clearly could have beat the crap out of me with one punch.  Other than that, there were a lot of ""what are YOU doing here?"" looks from fellow customers.  I kept wishing I had brought my sista friend with me, who would have loved this place.

I'd go back, but it's not a perfect choice.  Perhaps on a Saturday when church hadn't just let out.  Also, the price is extreme - it's almost as high as Knott's Berry Farm which gives you more food for only about $2 more, and that's at theme park prices.  This is just dumpy outskirts of downtown..but again, I don't wanna judge.  I love small business and I'm proud of Mrs. White for making it this long; hope she continues for a long time to come.",2

As it was Global Brand, I trusted and Expected more from the Specs advertised or mentioned, But from 1st day of delivery i found it was Defective. Yes Defective Product delivered by Amazon India.

Coming to Device Review :- Only Display sAmoled with Full HD+ was good, and some how The one ui was good.
Battery backup was like 4000 mah only, processor heats a lot up-to 46 degree.
 And consumes more power, power hungry processor, so battery lasts less time.
Product was Feel like cheap because poor build quality, makes back panel and sides crackling sound.
Even One ui having ads, yes but it can be stopped when initial setup of device to not to receive any marketing information unlike Xiaomi.
Cameras also Above Average, front camera is below Average only.
Overall Not expected from Samsung Brand.
For the Display Only I am giving 2 stars, rest was a crap, because of Overheating of Device when Using Normally without Gaming, and Battery drains a lot in idle also.",0

positive,"I stopped by early this morning to satisfy my crave for something new. The place is very clean and a man came out to greet me and was ready to serve. He clearly explained every item I was curious about since the labels were in Spanish. I asked if his name was Miguel and he said yes. I told him I read about his bakery on Yelp. Then he said that he loves Yelp and that's how word is going around now for him and he also uses to find reviews on other places. He was very friendly and had lots of patience. I was the only customer at the time and he actually doesn't mind having a conversation unlike open ended talks with others. I ended up buying 10 pastries and it cost $6.80. What a great deal!


They also sell other items such as tamales, burritos, and menudo. I inquired about the burritos cuz I like mine with a little kick,but unfortunately they weren't ready yet. He showed me the homemade tortillas and he says he used them on the burritos. He said they don't look big, but he assured that the burritos are filled with red (mild) or green (with a kick) chili, shredded pork, and some potatoes. He said that one burrito is good to fill up a person. So...I must come back and try it. 


So far I've had the flaky pastry with the shredded coconut and Bavarian cream...the Bavarian wasn't as creamy than I'm used to. I almost thought it would have been better off to not have it, but it's a nice added flavor when you eat it all together rather than just tasting the Bavarian on its on. 


I had that curvy, pretty looking pastry which is topped with crystal sugars and with all the sugar on top, I thought it might be too sweet, but nope. It was just fine with the pineapple filling (excuse me as I wipe my drool). 


Then it was off to have the caramel flautas dusted with powdered sugar. The first bite was eh. The second bite was...um. Third bite, WOW! I finally reached the part that had more caramel in it and I LOVE IT!!! Did I mention that I'm not a big fan of caramel? This caramel is sweet and creamy. It's just so good! A definitely must have for next time.

That's about as much my tummy let me eat for today. I'm sure the rest will be just as good and I can't wait till tomorrow morning to try to rest of my goodies.",2

positive,"Is this great sushi?  No.  Does this food reinvent the sushi wheel?  Not even close.  Will I have a foodgasm?  Not a chance. When I am craving an amazing sushi meal, I'll go to Yasu.

Why I really, REALLY like Teharu:
The food is fresh.  While it's not amazing fish, there's nothing wrong with it - nothing here to get sick from.
All the standards are readily available and if you want something not already on the belt, they'll gladly make it for you.
The conveyor really feeds into my lack of patience.  I sat down, ordered an iced green tea, and started pulling plates off the belt.  Yes, I was eating sushi within 90 seconds of sitting down!
The price is a HUGE plus!  I met a friend for lunch - we each had iced tea, several plates with 3 or 4 roll slices, seaweed salad, sunumono salad and a couple nigiri and I was out of there for less than $20, including tip.
The place is kept incredibly clean, staff is friendly and Teharu fills a nice niche for a super casual, quick sushi place.  When it comes down to it, I can't always afford to spend what that quantity of food would cost me at Yasu or any of the other great places in town - I like that I am not committing to a whole roll - I can sample from 5 or 6 different ones.

Fills the need for the sushi craving on a buget and/or when strapped for time.",2

As soon as you walk into Don and Charlie's your eyes start feasting on all the signed baseballs down the left wall.  Now everywhere you look from floor to ceiling and even the ceiling itself is covered in memorabilia and autographed items from athletes of all sports and other celebrities.   Besides the amazing assortment of sports artifacts, I especially like the Cactus League Beer List which pairs a beer with each city that has a team in the Cactus League.  Colorado = Coors Light , Texas =Shiner Bock, Chicago =Old Style, and San Diego =Stone IPA, etc.  Also worth mentioning is the complimentary chopped liver platter with rye bread and bagel chips they bring as soon as you are seated.  I had the ribs with coconut shrimp combo which was great. I wasn't thrilled with the side dish: potato's au gratin which is a $2.50 upcharge.  They also bring a huge bowl of cole slaw with each entrée or you can choose soup which comes in a smaller bowl than the cole slaw!  We were too full for dessert and as we walked out, this place was packed!  I found myself trying to take in as much memorabilia as possible and then on one side of the crowded lobby there sat Willie Mays himself.  He was signing his book (or a baseball) for a $200 charitable donation to his foundation. Needless to say, I 'm not bringing home any memorabilia myself!",2

The Picture clarity in the Rear Camera is very detailed with proper light effects in case of LOW / VERY Low Light, the 64MP Option should be used when you have no worry about storage space and you know that every single Photo that you will take using this option will be 10MB+ going up to 25MB depending on the details captured in the image.
The Front Camera of 20MP is also very stable and takes good images.
It is nice to say that Redmi does not apply any default BEAUTIFICATION effect to your photos just like REALME does!

Actually, I had purchased this phone to replace my iPhone 6s, however, I was totally dissatisfied as there is No software for any data transfer between iPhone and Redmi for that matter Redmi phones do not have any INBUILT application for data transfer from Android to Android or iOS to Android which is why the rating is reduced by 2 Points. It seems to me that Redmi has manufactured and thought of mobile phones for FIRST TIME BUYERS only! So this issue is not addressed, and maybe it can be looked into if they want to! In comparison, if you check for M30s from Samsung (similar specs and price), you get a default option of moving your data including SMS, Contacts, Photos etc without any problems from iOS or Android!

About the return option and contacting Amazon / Redmi, the Customer Care at Amazon are absolutely clueless and will not say a word about the purchase, will simply ask you to contact the customer care of Apple OR Redmi (whatever are the 2 phones that you have - Old and New), the Redmi Customer Care person will say you can download the apps called XANDER etc, which are of no use and third-party apps which won't help at all in any transfer of data.

Please note that though AMAZON may mention RETURN POSSIBLE UP TO __ NOV 2019, actually you cannot return the phone unless the phone is received in a PHYSICALLY DAMAGED condition which would have to be proved to Amazon by sending the Photos to them and if they think it is genuine, else RETURN IS NOT POSSIBLE!!!

Most cheap drive through fast food Mexican places are alike. Of course there are slight differences. In this case it wasn't for the better.

We had to drive up to the window to order. The speaker box wasn't working? What was going on there?

I ordered a chicken chimichanga with sour cream & guacamole on the side. The chimi was big, just like I expected it to be. There wasn't much guacamole. I would have liked more. They also put tomatoes in it. That's ok, I'm just mentioning it. All in all this chimi just didn't sit as well as others I've had. Maybe it was the spices they used that were different, I'm not sure.

I also ordered a large horchata. I have definitely had better. It wasn't the worst I've ever had but it needed more cinnamon flavor, that's for sure.

It's cheap, it's easy, it's fast, it's literally right down the street from me. I'd still rather make the drive over to 7th St to my fave 'bertos though. See: http://www.yelp.com/biz/rolbertos-phoenix",0

First off you have to understand that the cuts are top quality so you can order almost any steak off the menus and be dazzled by the flavor, which is fantastic to the point that adding anything to it would destroy the integrity of the taste as is.
 I mean the meat is perfection on a plate and this needs no other explaining.

If with friends or even your significant other you must start with the the seafood tower, which can be order in many different ways to match your appetite and likes. When presented at the table you and your guests will be blown away at the quality of the seafood and rightly so as it is brought in fresh daily.

The sides are too awesome in their taste and quality and i suggest the Lobster mash or the Maestros Mash potatoes neither of which will leave you hungry in their own right, but often wanting more :)

 Samsung lost its  potential.

positive,"I had not planned on being a Mac owner.  My family - oh so very sick of me constantly complaining of Vista -  on first an HP, then a Dell, packed me off to the Apple store a month ago and well, now I have a MacBook.  The sales associate helping me pick out the perfect Mac was good enough, even with two perfectly good (except for the Vista) PCs at home, to convince me I needed this computer.

Do I love it? Not yet.  I like it, like it a lot.  I'm especially loving not having Vista issues that I had been having.  

I'm enjoying taking the one on one classes  to teach me how to use my Mac.  Each time I take a class - I've had 4 now, I have a different teacher and each one bringing a different spin to my classes.  They are nice, friendly, patient, highly knowledgeable.  They are teaching me so many cool features and applications that I can do on my Mac.  My fave so far is the translator.  I do some business in Mexico - my Spanish is limited - so in just one short month the translator has just been a god send.

The store here at the Biltmore is consistently packed with people, visiting the genius bar, taking group classes or the one on one class and making expensive purchases. I am amazed in this economy just how very busy the store is.  

I'm not totally convinced a Mac is the only way to go (almost though) but this store has some of the best customer service I've ever experienced.",2

I ordered the green pork tostada which the waiter assured me was very small and the hot wings. The tostada was huge. What a liar (yes, I called him that to his face). 

I ate a couple of bites and finished the wings. I would have the tostada cold and congeal-y in the morning before flying out. Surprisingly, the flavors were locked in this way and acceptable as a 5-minute scarf fest.

He was very funny, inviting, and did a great job with everyone's food. We had a range of dishes from seafood to chicken to very well done steak and our chef handled it all with his silly little giggle. 

The happy hour prices can't be beat, but man once you get out of happy hour, the drink prices are STEEP! We had drinks, appetizers, sushi, and then teppanyaki. The calamari was chewy, but the bbq chicken egg rolls are great.  The drinks were yummy. I have no idea what kind of sushi we had, but it was pretty darn tasty too. 

The only reason this isn't a five star review is that our server had the personality of a rock. If he cracked a smile, it might have killed him. We spent collectively close to $500 and I don't think he could have cared any less about us. Too bad too because it reflected in his tip and generally we are pretty generous tippers.

To say if you want to make call when the phone is locked it will take 30 second to do that. While making call also you can hear the ring but you can't see the display if you want to turn on loud speaker you need to wait for another 10 seconds,

negative,"Earlier this week, we used our handy Google mobile app to locate what we hoped was authentic Mexican food. We were craving flavorful salsa and well-spiced meat dishes after a long, warm day in the desert. What we found here was slightly different than we were expecting......The chips were made of corn AND flour tortillas, which was a nice surprise but way too filling while waiting for our food. The salsa was just fresh tomatoes with some cilantro (or maybe even parsley?) for color.
It was ""Taco Tuesday"", which here meant all-you-can-eat of crunchy or soft with 3 different filling choices.""Hamburger Helper-esque flavored shredded beef tacos"", according to my teen son. Ooops :( I ordered the ""award-winning green chili sweet tamale"". I fear they left the winners with the judges, for they didn't make it to my table. The tamales were dry and contained about a tablespoon of chopped chiles throughout. And, although they were sweet as promised, they lacked depth of flavour overall.
The service was fine and the refills on soft drinks was fair, but I really was hoping for more. We are in town for a couple of weeks and may try it one more time since it's close to our accommodations, but with all these Tex-Mex and MexiCali flavour houses to choose from, it will take a lot to win us over for a better review.",0

positive,"Before all of you band together to burn me at the stake, let me explain.  I have a reason for wanting to review a chain such as Del Taco!

I went here the other day and was shocked.  The staff is nice.  And I'm not just talking fake friendly.  They were genuinely kind and seemed happy to be at work.  In fact, the guy at the counter asked me how my weekend was, so in return, I asked about his.  You know what he said?  ""Perfect.""  He said his weekend was perfect.  I can't remember the last time I had a perfect weekend.  Lucky him.

The food is pretty good too and I especially enjoy their spicy jack quesadilla.  My nachos did not come with any cheese though- not sure if that was a mistake or not.  Just chips.  False advertising. 

Anyways, everyone who works there was exceptionally nice.  Why?  This has never happened to me before.  Was I their first customer of the day or are they really just nice people happy with their jobs?  They must pay well there... Is the secret to being happy in life working at Del Taco??",2
neutral,"Display : Very Good
Audio : Good
Performance : Very good
Sensors : Finger Print face unlock are very fast
And the main Problem is with Battery
Though it has 5000 mah it doesn't give backup in that range It drains Quickly Even in low brightness with location off
For gamers backup may not be sufficient
Redmi note 7 pro also has the same problem and because of SD 675 but MI fixed it through updates they optimised battery well But VIVO doesn't solved this even after 4 months of release If that was fixed I would 5 out 5",1

Had the biscuits& gravy special ( $10.95 ), no bueno. I like my gravy simple...just some gravy with a little sausage running through,thats it. Can't stand it when there is onions, peppers, celery, carrot...yuck!! And they served those generic potatoes that are big flavorless cubes that they put in the deep fryer.

Don't let the location of a strip mall deter you from this place. The food is absolutely perfect. I had the bouillabaisse while my 2 table mates had steak. Each dish was prepared perfectly. The service was also some of the best service we have ever had at any restaurant. The waitress was so attentive & detail oriented. I never had to ask for anything, she always knew exactly what I needed. My water & iced tea was never below halfway. At the end of the meal, the owner/chef came out to greet us & that was such a nice gesture. We were so happy to compliment him & his restaurant. My visiting family even said that they would gladly come back to this place on their next visit. This place is so great & you just need to go visit it!",2

How do you say, ""Damn that was good!"" in German?  I have new found respect for German cuisine thanks to Chef Hoffman (not sure about the spelling there).

The fubar of Yelpers (I am pretty sure that is the correct term for a large gathering of Yelpers) dined on the patio which is a great space.  Service was very good throughout the meal.

The restaurant was very clean and I enjoyed the music playing, but I think it could use a little more color in the dining room. I was greeted upon entering and was asked if I had been here before. The waiter was very friendly and took the time to explain some of the dishes to me. I asked about the pof pof and he explained that they are like donuts, but better. I passed on them. I ordered the jerk steak over jolof rice, a meat patty, and plantains. First came out the meat patty. The pastry tasted like cornmeal to me, and not flakey like I had hoped. The filling was quite good and just enough spice without going overboard. The steak was very tender and flavorful, with a little bit of heat. For the price, you get your money's worth and I'll have enough left-overs for tomorrow's lunch. Before leaving, the waiter gave me a complimentary pof pof, and in my opinion, it was better than a donut.

I'll definitely be going there again.

positive,"I went here with my husband last Sunday afternoon.  We had a 2 for 1 coupon out of the Entertainment guide.  We are from San Diego and have been trying to find Mexican food places similar to the food out in San Diego.  We pulled up to the location and were debating if we should go in or not.  The area wasn't the best, and it was in a tiny strip mall.  Kind of looked like a taco shop.  We decide to go in, because we were starving.  Inside it looked completely different.  It was a little dark and dated.  But the atmosphere was very causal and the hosts were super nice.  We sat down and right away got some nice warm chips, salsa and beans served to us.  I was feeling like a margarita and was going to get the house one, when the waitress said they had 99 cent margaritas available.  We ordered our food and didn't have to wait very long to get it.  Super good food and really cheap 99 cent margaritas. The margaritas were served in pretty nice size glasses but a bit strong.  FYI, I think you're getting really cheap alcohol in there, seemed pretty stiff. I started buzzing after my second glass.   My husband even loved the Chile reino that he tried from my plate.  He usually doesn't like it at all.  The carne asada was seasoned very well, it was a great change from some of the bland Mexican food I've had out here in phoenix. My husband had the beef chimichanga and it was seasoned really well also.  For the price you can't beat it.  From the outside the restaurant seems a little ghetto looking, but once you get inside it's pretty nice in there.  I would defiantly try it again.",2

positive,"OnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.

But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.

PROS (POSITIVES):

1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.

2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.

3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.

4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.

5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.

6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.

7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.

8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.

9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.

10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.

11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.

12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.

13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.

14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.

15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.

MIDS (NEUTRAL):

1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.

2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?

3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.

CONS (NEGATIVES):

1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.

2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.

VERDICT:

Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.",2

negative,"I have been using the phone for the last 15 days and what I have noticed is that the network speed and stability of the network are very bad compared to other branded phones I used before. Usually, the LTE speed and coverage inside my house and On the balcony are pretty stable but when I changed to M30S the network will shuffle between E and H+ and from time to time, it goes to LTE with the low signal (Normally 2 out of 4 bars). When i go through the customer review on Amazon i get to know that it's not an isolated incident. A lot of customers are facing the same problem.
This phone is working very slow with WIFI netwrk and connection is also not stable.
Cause of this issue is :- M30s is powered with  Exynos , snapdragon powered SOC's( 675,710,712) support LTE category-15 with a download speed of 800 Mbps whereas the Exynos has category-12 with a downloading speed of 600 Mbs. This is the cardinal reason for the low data speed and network issue.",0

They've only been open since February and had relied on fliers and the painted signs on the windows to attract customers. While I was there, supremely enjoying the chicken curry roti, a few other people came in because they drove by and saw the sign. 

I couldn't decide between the jerk chicken or the curry for my roti, so I was given samples of both. I thought the jerk chicken was a little too hot for me, but the curry still was able to clear out my sinuses. Wow - slow burn! I was told they could tone down the heat upon request. I'm not sure I'd want to ruin the experience, though. 

The menu looked interesting - goat curry, oxtail - along with the jerk and the curry options. I opted for the guava nectar to drink (so yummy!). 

This is in my neighborhood so I'll definitely be back to try some more. The atmosphere was comfortable and I was encouraged to linger longer, but I needed to get on with my day. The food and the music piped in made me feel like I took a mini-vacation. Nice.",2

So, we show up and the kid working the door says in a very ""Spicolli-like"" voice, ""uh.... our credit card machine is broken tonight""..... So we replied that we were on expense accounts and would there be any way they could manually run our credit cards... The guy replies, ""dude, you're outta luck""....

Funny, considering that I am a guy who eats out a lot and am not afraid to spend a lot of money in a place when the food and service is good... I wont be going back in there...

So we made our way to Hiro..... We were pissed and hungry after driving around and dealing with idiots all over town. Hiro was just what the doctor ordered. We sat down and were greeted and served drinks right away. We put our sushi order entirely in the hands of our chef who did not disappoint. He brought out order after order of fresh delicious sushi and sashimi... We had beer, sake and a great night.... When it was said and done, we spent about $250 for the two of us which was a lot but well worth it..... I'm sure you could go and have a great meal for much less, but we were going big and NOT PAYING!!!!!

My Cevapi (little beef sausages with fresh bread, onions and a  sour cream like dip) came out piping hot and piled high. My friends Burek was huge (hmm not sure hot to explain so you will have to look that one up) and we both dived in like it was the last meals we would ever have.

My BF and I went to Roma Garden for dinner last night because he was given a gift certificate there from a friend.  We'd never heard of it, but we're always up for trying something new, especially with $50 towards our meal.  We pulled up to their strip mall location without expectations and we were both pleasantly surprised!

When you walk in, the lighting and decor are welcoming and the staff is friendly and attentive.  It was a Thursday night and there were plenty of other guests in the restaurant, and there was a lively energy in the air.  After browsing the menu, I ordered one of the few 'Chef's Specials' of the night - tilapia with fresh veggies and pasta in a lemon caper sauce.  BF went with Pollo Parmagiana.  He had a glass of cabernet and I had pinot grigio... and voila - a warm bread basket arrived on our table at just the right time!

We were both happy with our orders when they arrived as well... the fish was cooked just right and the sauce was tasty... good portions as well!  Although we were full, we decided to order a dessert to share - the homemade snow white chocolate tartufo - yum!  The perfect sweet ending to our meal.  In addition, we were each brought an after dinner drink of amaretto on the rocks, on the house.

****I just have to share that I was pleasantly surprised that the women's restroom was clean, spacious, and had a fresh fragrance to it - I normally don't notice that, but I was impressed by this!

In speaking to the waiter and the owner, we learned that this restaurant recently changed locations but they've been in business for over 15 years.  Gotta love the local businesses that last in the valley... we'll be back to support Roma Garden and enjoy their fine ""Northern Italian Cuisine"" without a doubt.  I suggest you go check it out also - bon appetito!",2

The display is decent, I mean you can see the pixels if you stare at it and strain your eyes, so that's not how you use it. Fingerprint sensor is not bad, I think it is much faster than when I got it, so that is good.
Only thing I'm mad about is that it doesn't use its only notification led it has got, It just lights when you are charging and that's it, what a waste of something that could've been a good old feature to have. I have to literally unlock the device every time to check for notifications which is a bummer.
Camera is great, both front and back. The battery is amazing, 24 hours since last charge, still 30% of juice left. I'm waiting for the Android 10 update, the dark mode in it plus the AMOLED screen I expect nothing short of magic to happen.

positive,"Bosa Donuts at Southern and Mcklintock in Tempe is part of a strip mall that I have been visiting since I was just a kid. Except, back then, Bosa Donuts was a Taco Bell. A few years back Taco Bell moved a half mile down the road into a new building and Bosa Donuts set up shop. About a year ago I discovered another new store in this strip mall which is Fallout Games, an awesome video game store. For this entire last year I've been driving past Bosa on my way out of the complex after visiting Fallout Games and taking a curious look as I drive by but until this week I had never tried it. After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, I had to give it a go.

Well, first off, It's 24 hours, which is huge in my book since I'm almost always up until four or five in the morning. The drive through display is lighted and shows their menu but you have to actually order by pulling up to the window. Since I was there at 3am I asked what was fresh at the moment and the guy was very patient and helpful with listing off what he had available. I just got a few frosted donuts (or raised, as they call them) and was on my way. Right off the bat, I noticed the box was pretty heavy. I only ordered a half dozen but it felt at least as heavy as it does when I get a dozen at Dunkin Donuts. When I got home, I opened the box and realized their donuts are at least thirty percent bigger than Dunkin Donuts of Krispy Kreme.

Anyway, the donuts are awesome. Best tasting donuts I've ever had. I probably shouldn't make it a habit to come here twice a week, if I want to live past forty, but I'll definitely be stopping by once or twice a month from now on. Hope this place sticks around.",2

The first and the foremost quality of any MOBILE PHONE IS TO MAKE PHONE CALLS, AND THIS HAS THE WORST, IT FAILS TO MAKE CALL IN FIRST ATTEMPT MOST TIMES, I NEED TO RESTART TO GET NETWORK. EVEN WHEN IM STANDING NEAR THE TOWER. IT DOES NOT EVEN CATCH THE 4G NETWORK.
Sometimes fails to detect finger print.
Bad speakers, not even properly audible in full volume. On earphones it's great with Dolby atmos.",0

positive,"Hi, I purchased Samsung M30 phone, on June 4th 2019. Prior selecting/buying this phone, I was looking for a phone with Good display, big screen, good internal memory, good RAM,Good Battery, a processor capable of handling multiple applications, more camera options as I like taking pictures and videos , a dedicated memory slot along with separate slim slots, and finally a phone which would not hang or crash and within my budget of Rs15K.
These were my long list of requirements for a smart phone. I was looking for a good branded phone as well. Then in Amazon I came across the Samsung Galaxy M30, Which exactly met my requirements, with 6.44 inch screen, 5000 Mah battery, Triple camera at the back with And good selfie camera with great resolution, and going on meeting exactly my requirement.
I was little bit skeptical in the beginning, in a doubt whether this phone will perform well. But after using the phone for 2+ months, I found that I have made the right choice, and I liked the great amaloed display which makes the phone a premier one. I have using this phone , where I downloaded multiple apps, to do some audio mix for an internal event, and it came out very well.  On connecting the earphones we have dolby atoms sound effect which gives a very good sound for hearing music. I found this phone very much within the budget which made me happier. Thank You",2

positive,"Review after ine week of usuage:-
Design: The design is gorgeous with glacier blue colour having a gradient finish on the back. The camera module is somewhat a personal prefercence but in 2019 with all phones looking exactly same from back side it does give it a different look. Personally i really like the camera island type design.
Screen: The screen is full hd amoled 90hz refresh rate screen. Its again gorgesous to look at,media content looks amazing,and once u start using 90hz refresh rate its dificult to go back to normal 60hz refresh rate. Its something which can be experience d and cant be explained.
Camera : The triple camera set up does the job, the main sensor is 48mp sensor which takes great shots in daylight/natural light, ultrawide lens is great for taking wider view and is a superb addition to main camera. Portrait shots have good depth and does a good job at separating object with the background. The best feature has to be the macro mode,it takes some great macro shots ,with subject as close as two inches, all the food bloggers will love this feature .
Performance: Fast, performance is just fast ,u throw anything at it it just doesnt lag, multitasking is butter smooth.
Battery : battery is decent ,gets almost one full day around 15-17hrs at heavy usuage. But charging is super fast,plug in and u get 0-70 in almost half hour.
Over all at this price point ,this phone has top notch specs,and delivers the performace thats expected out of it.
Only Asus Rog phone 2 is near and in some cases better than this phone at this orice,but dats a game centric phone and may be not everyones cup of tea.
Last words: If u are in market for a new one,under 40k price bracket and want all the flagship features ,great performace and software experience and all round performibg camera...Do go for this phone !!!!",2

neutral,"Meh... I am surprised to read all the reviews about the clean store everyone else wrote about. In my experience, the toppings area looked like it had all merged to become one big nest. There were also speckles and swipes of fro-yo in all places imaginable... floor, counters, scale... And, I wanted to try a couple flavors, but there was no one around to help. Also, the checkout lady was soooooo dreary! With her monotone listlessness, she made me feel as depressed as Sylvia Plath! (just kidding, but she couldn't have been more doldrums if she tried)

I usually go to Yogurtology at Town & Country mall (on Camelback just east of the 51). That place is always amazing... Pristine clean, neat, organized, always a peppy guy by the machines with little sampler cups, a guy who had one too many Red Bulls and is nearly throwing at least one sample of every single flavor at every single person who walks in the door, with a funny, witty little quip and a great personality and WAY too damn much energy. But it's nice.

THAT is what I had in mind when I discovered THIS place. I was excited. It was so much nearer to my house... great location (stupid layout though, prone to human traffic jams).

I really, really want to like Yogurtland, but I just can't talk myself into it. The fro-yo was good (aside from the fact that I had trouble getting toppings without being too grossed out since it was a mess), but that was about it. All in all, they're lucky I felt generous today and gave them 3 stars, because I really had to talk myself out of giving them only 2.

The atmosphere is really wonderful, a rarity in Phoenix. The food is very consistent and almost everything on the menu is unique and flavorful. I must agree with some of the other reviews, that the waitstaff is very hit-or-miss. I've had wonderful service and terrible service, and there are times when I've had to go and ask the bartender to send someone over to our table to take our order... as regulars, in particular, I wouldn't think that this would be something we would have to deal with. That being said, there was one time when they were understaffed and the manager was very apologetic and even sent us a bunch of appetizers free of charge as an apology... so I haven't personally experienced the attitude that others report. I miss Fez... now I live in San Diego. When I go to visit, it's always on the itinerary, every time, usually as soon as I land.",2

The great thing about the venue is that you can stand almost anywhere and still be able to see the band. There's a big bar inside with friendly bartenders, although the well drinks can be a little pricey. There's usually a hot dog vendor outside and most of the bands performing can be found walking around before and/or after their sets, making it easy to mingle. The downside about the Marquee is that parking sucks. There's not a ton of parking in the club's lot and the nearby lots usually fill up fast so be prepared to trek down Mill to get to and from your car if you don't arrive early.",1

When it comes to RAM, it handles it all. The camera is pretty impressive and the display is an infinite making it amazing to view at. The battery life on the other hand, is long enough letting you do whatever you want to. Even if the battery is low, it charges up extremely fast enough to enjoy your phone once again. The fast charger is a unique and a must have one. The camera has all the settings of that a professional camera, making it an amazing option to have. I highly recommend this for all students.",2

negative,"I recently moved to the area of Westgate AMC and, even though it's not the closest, I thought I would give it a try. It's probably one of the most beautifully laid out and convenient movie houses I've been in. And for the first several visits, I didn't have too much of a bad experience. In fact, the only thing wrong was the ticket machines outside were down - apparently, I've heard that happens a lot, if they've ever worked.

This last trip was just plain bad. I went to see Piranha 3D and the 3D screen was fairly small, especially for a wide release on opening night. The 3D was off a bit, but then that might be this old person's eyes; I could see shadows and lines behind some of the target objects.

I arrived 45 minutes early and I mistakenly thought I would be too late to get a good seat for a 6:30 PM showing. By all means, I was approximately 30 minutes too early. They booked the showings way too close. The previous showing's credits ran until about 6:10, and then they, as always, took their time to clean out the theater. Once in, finally, the theatre was almost pitch black aside from dim lights on the staircases. The Pre-Show countdown, which I normally despise, would've been welcome, if just for some light. Well, that's why God made cell phones.

Upon finally sitting, there were two soda pop cans in the two cup holders - way to go, clean-up crew. I literally saw 7 people leave the theatre when that showing ended. Cleaning up should've been quick so you can continue your discussion about who's ID you'd use to go out that night.

But I digress, the soda pop cans were obviously not sold by the world's slowest concession employees. I just moved them over and the lights finally came on a bit roughly 7 minutes before the show. Typically, I hate when people have their cell phones lit up in the theatre, as they always want to hold them up high so the entire rest of the theatre gets the pleasure of the bright light while they babble on their ancient MySpace account. But, in this case, it's understandable as no one could see anything.

Question, and I've always wanted to ask this, are the employees at the concession stand told to go as slow...as...possible? Fine, I know they're not - I'm a former AMC employee and I wasn't. Although, the pennies they generously give in the paychecks might not put the right fire under them. But seriously, it's already an insult that we have to pay about $13 just for one popcorn and one soda, but they add the salt, on the wound, that is, by making us wait 20 minutes in a line of 3 people.

By God, I wish someone would open a concession stand with somewhat good deals - yeah, I know that's how they get their money, blah, blah, and I wish someone would open at least an express lane. ""Two Items or Less Lane! No Children!"" Heaven.

Really, movies are still relevant, even in a down economy. Perhaps you should hire less and pay more. I'm sure the one guy at the box office would've appreciated that.",0

Going into NYC just wasn't an option each time I wanted some half sours and a knish.   It took moving to Scottsdale, AZ to find a solution - go figure.

The gigantic menu you'd expect, pretty good bagels, great breads, not to mention the grilled cheese/Jewish sliders/patty melt/kosher dog with kraut/knish/fresh chips/potato salad/macaroni salad - all are awesome.  I did not care for the Reuben I tried, however, I am crazy picky about corned beef and I realize that a true NY deli serves the meat a little fatty so that's my hangup.  Husband had an omelet today that could have fed 4 people - he loved it.

positive,"This is a review after four full days of continuous usage.
Starting with the build quality, it's a absolute beauty. Even though it is on a heavier side, the modeling is very nicely done.
Like everyone is complaining about the 720p display, it is true a FHD was expected even if the phone has a AMOLED screen. It is quite noticeable when it comes to the app drawer. The phone still let's you watch videos in high quality HD when it comes to Netflix and other applications where I didn't really find any difference. The AMOLED screen still does a good enough job for daily usage.
Coming to the sound, it is pretty decent with a mono speaker providing more of treble and clarity. Xiaomi still gives out two vents for speaker but one of which is dummy. I personally like mono speakers in mobile phones.
Coming to the processing speed, it does a decent job. Just to test I filled most of the storage and i didn't come across and system lagging.
PUBG still doesn't run on HD, but a it still gives a better frame rate in medium settings.
The fingerprint is not as quick as it should be, but as they've provided a in screen scanner, it should make up for it. The face unlock has good speed too.

Coming to camera, the 48 megapixels doesn't make it of much difference as the aperture is low. It still takes good pictures in natural and artificial light. The only drawback is the wide angle! You wouldn't feel like capturing images from the wide angle camera.
The front facing camera could do better with the software updates as the white balance is a little off.
The night mode is average but I really wouldn't expect more at this price range.

In the past four days, I've not experienced any heating issues even after heavy usage of the product which I am really happy about.
The battery does an amazing job. Even though I expected them to provide with a fast charging adapter as the current one is really slow, you can still but a 18W compatible adapter for fast charging if you want.

The only dislikes on this product i've had is the 720p screen, the hybrid sim slot, the wide angle lens and the charging adapter. Rest assured.

Ratings :
Display 3.5/5 ( only for not providing FHD)
Sound 4/5
Camera 4/5
Build quality 4.5/5
Battery 4.5/5
Speed 4/5
Price 4.5/5
Overall 4/5

positive,"My boyfriend and I decided to drive around Scottsdale and find a place for dinner on a Saturday night. Our initial impression of the place was that it was going to be too rich for our blood; however, we figured we would give it a shot. The decor reminded my boyfriend of nightclub scene from Scarface. 

When they sat us down initially we were right next to the kitchen which wasn't too pleasant. So we asked to be moved to another location and the hostess moved us into their private dinning room which we loved. 

Our server was very friendly and informative, yet also gave us space. We ordered crab cakes to start things off. They were excellent but slightly over priced given the portion size. Then we ordered a bottle of wine that was very reasonably priced and to our liking for $24 - a nice Argentinian Malbec. We decided on this bottle after our server brought us several other tastes. I ordered the soup of the day and my boyfriend got a caesar salad. Both were solid. For entrees I got a salmon with asparagus and my boyfriend ordered seared ahi tuna. Both were cooked to perfection.

Overall, being in the private dining room was perfect, noise level wise, and all of the staff made sure everything was up to par without being too over zealous. I would highly recommend this place.",2

1. Vibrant screen.
2. Camera is pretty nice.
3. Battery lasts one day on full charge, at normal use.
4. Charging is quite fast: around 10% in 10 to 12 minutes.
5. Looks very good, blue color is a stunner.

Cons:
1. No notification light, this is more of a problem than it sounds. You never know if you have notifications pending.
2. Fingerprint sensor is really  small and at the same level as the rest of the back cover, and is not depressed. You keep touching all over the backside of the phone without finding the sensor. Really really irritating. Takes like 5 tries to unlock the phone.
3. Fingerprint sensor could have been faster.
4. Screen is really nice, but on the Lee side, it hurts to use such a bright screen at night.

negative,"We went to ""THE PLACE"" for breakfast/lunch today. It must be a popular spot and was very busy. There were 2 specials of the day, Eggs Benedict and a French Toast stack. Both came with a choice of potatoes.
I went here based on the reviews from fellow Yelpers. 
My daughter ordered the burger, it came with fries AND salad for under 7.00. The burger was very well done, but it was 1/2 lb of ground beef. The fixings were on the side and it arrived on an unremarkable hamburger bun. The fries were crisp and the salad was fine but it was DRENCHED in a watered down thousand island dressing.
My eggs benedict was fine. Nothing to make me want to order it again, but not bad either. I would try their pancakes next time. They looked pretty good!
My husband's french toast stack arrived. 3 pieces of french toast with ham,egg and swiss cheese between the layers. Kinda like a Monte Cristo sandwich. They bring out warm maple and berry syrup. My husband liked it. But, said he would try something else next time.
I ordered my hashbrowns extra crispy, my husband ordered his ""burnt"", his order came out exactly how i wanted mine. Crispy dark golden and cooked well. Bummer I had to just eat the top of mine. We also wanted to try the biscuits and gravy. What a big let down. Quantity does not equal quality. The biscuits were large, and the gravy bland. Our service was ok. The people working there seem nice enough. They were giving out free THE PLACE frisbees.
They will be closing 7/21 and will re open 8/1 at the new location right up the street at 51st ave and Bell rd, in the old 3 Margaritas building.
Hopefully I will be able to update this one day and give a better rating.

positive,"With this all new U series Vivo has entered into a budget oriented youth centric segment. The most exceptional feature of this phone which no other device in this price segment provides is 18W fast charging support with an in-box 18W charger. There’s lot more under the hood, to know let’s dig a little deeper, if you're in a hurry then do check the summary below with some sample shots.

------------
Design:
------------
Vivo U10 comes in two colour variants thunder black and electric blue, I personally like thunder black due to its decent and classy look but that’s totally subjective. U10 comes with a water drop notch 6.35 inch HD+ IPS display that takes screen to body ratio to 89%. Although, it’s not an FHD display but still colour reproduction is quite decent and I didn’t faced any issue with this screen even in bright day light. The notch makes way for front camera and earpiece.

There’s a gradient finish glossy plastic back that gives a great in-hand feel but is a fingerprint magnet. Not to worry, there’s a back cover included in the box. Capacitive fingerprint reader sitting in the back unlocks the phone instantly. Also, there’s a triple camera setup with a LED flash in the back apart from the brand’s logo at the lower side.

Speaker grill, 3.5mm audio jack along with a micro USB port lies at the bottom of the phone. A type C port would’ve been great but Vivo has settled with micro USB, nonetheless, 18W charging makes it up. Volume rockers and power button are located at the right side and dual sim tray with a dedicated micro SD card slot is present in the left.

-------------
Hardware:
-------------
U10 houses the mid-range beast, Snapdragon 665 AIE which was launched earlier this year by Qualcomm. Presence of Adreno 610 GPU in this phone ensures a smooth graphic performance. U10 comes with 3 storage options 3+32/3+64/4+64, I bought the 3+64 variant as its quite adequate for a normal user but if you are a pro user then you must consider the higher one. Since there’s a dedicated memory card slot, storage can be expand up to 256 GB without sacrificing secondary sim. As I stated earlier U10 comes with a massive 5000 mAh battery and 18W fast charging support. It supports Bluetooth 5.0 and dual band Wi-Fi.

-----------------------------
Camera & Performance:
-----------------------------
Inside the triple AI camera setup, there’s a 13 MP primary sensor with f/2.2 aperture, 8 MP ultra-wide and a 2 MP depth sensor. On the front, an 8 MP sensor with a large f/1.8 aperture is present which clicks nice selfies. Although, these sensors can’t compete with the likes of 48 MP sensors but performs quite decent considering the pricing. I’ve attached a few samples clicked from this device to help decide yourself about the camera quality. I personally found colour contrast in the photos quite natural and clarity was fair too. The ultra-wide sensor takes nice wide shots and depth sensor plays its role perfectly by giving nice bokeh effect in portrait shots. In the camera App, other modes like Pro, AI beauty, panorama, slow motion, etc. are present as well.

With the Funtouch OS 9.1 built over Android Pie, U10 gives quite snappy performance. I didn’t faced any lags in UI navigation, app opening or even video streaming. For gamers, there’s a special ultra-game mode that takes the gaming experience to a next level. Adreno 610 GPU handles graphic intensive apps and games quite well. Those who’re familiar with Funtouch OS would have an idea about extra features and excellent optimisation it provides. Talking of the battery life, a full charge easily gets through a whole day of moderate usage leaving 20-25% battery still intact. U10 also supports face unlock and I must admit that it’s really fast but I would recommend fingerprint as a secured option.

--------------
Summary:
--------------
Overall, I must say that apart from few grey areas this phone definitely satisfies its price tag and if you’re seeking a smartphone that last longer and charges quickly then U10 is a perfect choice in budget segment. Summing up here’s a quick Pros and Cons.

-------
Pros:
-------
✔ 18W fast charging
✔ Bundled 18W charger
✔ 5000 mAh battery
✔ Triple camera setup
✔ Ultra game mode

--------
Cons:
--------
✖  No Type C port
✖  720p display

Apart from this the camera quality with having many more features is also great, also the screen is super hd, so while watching a video or a movie we literally everything is real and we are into it. Also high quality speakers are awesome one can easily play loud music in noisy environment, and finger print unlocking system on screen itself makes the phone look smart.

I brought in a huge selection of books I was interested in selling and they only took 4 of the books and offered me a few measely dollars. I was shocked.

positive,"I was initially going to give Riva's 3-stars, as they're really just like any other Filiberto's/Umberto's/Roberto's/Ernie and Berto's out there, except for a couple of small differences.

For one, everything seems to be just a little bit more fresh there.  It's probably not, but it tastes like it.  And secondly, their little salsa bar is killer because their green salsa has plenty of flavor and they always have fresh pico de gallo out there, a must for any burrito.

The California Burrito, with carne asada, potatoes, pico de gallo and cheese, is a must, as is the standard Carne Asada Burrito.  But the real winner here is the Carne Asada Fries.  A metric ton of carne asada piled on top of freshly fried french fries, sour cream, cheese and guacamole for only $5?  Can't be beat, especially if you're hammered and it's 3 A.M. 

Not a classy joint, not a place you go if you're wary of stupid crap like ""health code violations"" (the best places never are), but definitely a late-night hot-spot for the Mill crowd.  Lovely.

And it's not for sissies that don't like ham in their beans either, damnit.",2

positive,"How this place has less than four stars is a mystery to me. I have been 5 times and have taken out of towners here 2 out of the 5 and they all left saying it was yummy too. The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on.

Earpiece: 8/10
Earpiece on volte is very good. However on 2g network the quality is little above average

Additionaly

I got August security patch just after turning on the phone first time. Gaming not tested except on WCC Rivals. It was very smooth. If you have bigger hands then I don't actually recommend you. Buy 6.5 inch display phone. If you don't like gaming then also I don't recommend you. If you ask me there is not much difference between LTPS and AMOLED. Colors looks little saturated on AMOLED. Black levels are also looks good on LTPS.

Screen cast is working fine with Sony Bravia TV which I didn't expected because stock android works with Chromecast only. But it is working.

It looks like a Battery Phone on specs. Combination of AMOLED + 665 + HD+ Display + 6inch Display + 4000mah battery + stock android. It should give battery life equal to a phone with 4500mah battery but it doesn't look like.",2

Or maybe more than three lame stars.  As the two other previous reviewers have pointed out succinctly, the man who I assume to be the owner was extremely nice.  I made the 1.5 hour drive from Tucson to watch Avatar at Arizona Mills, and my friends and I decided to grab a bite before heading back.  We randomly drove down Baseline and pretty much stumbled upon this place.  Traffic going westbound towards the 10 was insane.  I mean it was bumper to bumper past Rural.  Anyway, I ask the guy who I assume is the owner why the traffic was so bad.  At first he didn't know, but then realized that the 60 was closed.  He politely recommended that we head south then cut across to get back to the 10.  

I ordered the Jerusalem Falafel sandwich. It was pretty good.  Though, in all honesty, falafel is not one those kind of dishes that one can gush over.  In my opinion, it's pretty hard to mess up deep frying ground chickpeas.  I ought to point out that the ingredients were very fresh.  This also applied to the side salad that comes with the combo meal.  My two friends opted for the gyros, and it looked good.  The meat was thinly sliced, which is somewhat different than others I've had.  They seemed to enjoy the meal, but I don't think they were quite overwhelmed by it either.  In fact, we didn't mention anything about the food during the hour and a half trip back home.  

The food is by no means bad at Pita Shack.  It's adequate to serviceable in terms of Mediterranean food.  The positives regarding the food have to be its freshness and price.  In fact, I spent no more than $8 for a sandwich, salad, and drink.  The service, as noted previously, is undoubtedly the most shining spot of the place.   As we were finishing up our meal, the guy who I assume is the owner offered us lentil soup on the house.  We declined after being quite filled and satisfied from our respective sandwiches.  I believe another reviewer had the same thing happen to him, and he had positive comments about it.  Now, for me it's was the food that really matters.  Accordingly, I gave three stars, as opposed to the four that I was close to giving.  Should I ever return to the Tempe area hankering for food in a pita, I would most definitely give Pita Shack another shot; if only to support a genuinely nice guy's business.",1

But if you're switching from Samsung , Motorola or any other reputed brand then you will find some touch issues as the screen isn't that responsive. But you will adjust to it in a week or two.

Pros
1.Camera- When I compared it with S10, M31 is superb
2.Battery-Lasts almost 2days of general use for completecharge
3.Display- Refreshin rate is really good and no lagging

Cons
1. Processor - They could have improved the processor. The only drawback i find in samsung phone is that heating issues.
2. Speaker - speaker is not upto a great effect
3. Fingerprint - They could have launched with in display sensor

Without these cons the really awesome and its a megamonster",2

I spent the first 26 years of my life in Southern New Mexico and I miss the food like CRAZY, especially green chile. When you walk into Arriba's it's New Mexico this and New Mexico that and the dishes are named after cities and landmarks in the state.

When we told the waitress that in New Mexico green chile sauce doesn't have pork in it she said, ""Well, we say that but it's not *really* New Mexican"" and walked off. What?!?!

The first time there we mentioned this to a Manager and got the same exact reaction. I also asked if I could get a side of plain green chile and was told no. Both times we were being super nice and just trying to start a friendly conversation, had these interactions been better this review wouldn't be here.

I'm far from being a vegetarian, I don't eat pork or beef because I don't like it. Also, I didn't ask about the red chile sauce because I'm not a fan, maybe it's porkless and amazing but I can't speak for that...

I ordered the Santa Fe Chicken salad.  Iceberg lettuce, slimy greens, cooked onions and bell peppers, mushy tomatoes, half melted greasy cheese clumps and very dry chicken piled on a shell... yuck.

On specs sheet they have mentioned all the Hi-Fi tech but the fact is some components are at the lowest quality. To start with, the Futuristic In-display fingerprint reader is the worst i have ever used and seen and it doesn't work 90% of times and you will literally get irritated and depressed more from this one feature. I would suggest Xiaomi to keep fingerprint sensor at the back like their other flagships. The display is AMOLED and brightness and feel is good, but when it comes to resolution in viewing videos or playing games(PUBG) i feel the worst display ever. Build quality is good. camera quality is another gimmick, The photo clarity is good in main lens but in wide angle camera and depth sensor camera are just worst part of the camera segment. You will loose clarity as you switch between lenses. Andriod UI is really great. Performance wise the phone is good for normal call, text and internet usage and not good for hardcore games.

So the meal didn't start out so great.  The spinach salad came out to me on a dirty place.  Sure, it's a restaurant.  I know other people use the same plates and silverware I'm using, but things like that, especially when noticed, are off-putting.  Unfortunately, the ahi tuna that followed was also overdone.  Not in a bad way, and I almost didn't notice through the thick peppercorn crusting, but when it was pointed out, I was a little disappointed.

That was when they pulled out dessert.

I'm not a sweets person.  I don't know that I've ever been.  Give me spicy or savory 10 times out of 10 over any kind of sweet-tasting anything.  Although my dentist might argue evidence to the contrary, I really just don't have a sweet tooth.  That being said, I wanted to die and be entombed in the citrus flan that was put in front of me.  I wanted to lick the plate clean and then go back to the kitchen and demand they fill my pockets, one with the smooth, creamy, more-like-custard-than-flan flan and the other with the wonderfully sweet and subtle citrus sauce they coated the dish with.  I'd also probably ask for some of the figs and berries to be put in a doggie bag.

I have never, in my entire life, enjoyed a dessert as much as this one.  I would happily drive the 20-plus minutes downtown just to have this again.

Before I forget or the keyboard shorts out from me drooling, the wine selection here is also amazing.  I didn't take time to look at the whole thing, but I think most wine connoisseurs would be happy here.

While it was a mixed bag, the place certainly deserves another trip.  I can see (if I had a real life, not one that consisted solely of studying) sitting out on their patio, enjoying Phoenix, and making a dent in their wine and cheese stocks.",2

I'm not a big fan of sauce that has any sugar in it which most do so to many their sauce is awesome. I prefer unsweetened everything.

The service is great and they are from New Jersey!  It's a great place to grab their special 2 slices and a coke for $4! YUM!",2

Caviar is served with mini toasts,  minced shallot, minced hard boiled egg white, minced hard boiled egg yolk, capers, creme fraiche, and I'm sure I'm forgetting other items served with it.  What a treat.  

As usual, we enjoyed chopped salad, fillets, scalloped potatoes, asparagus, espresso, butter cake, and a fantastic Cabernet.

Another A++ experience at Mastro's!!!!!",2

SCREEN:- the phone 120hz screen which is quite fast but the depth of color is not up to Samsungs screens I have s8+ which the screen is far more better in terms of color and depth of the image
CAMERA:- As of today the oneplus has created to camera as per the market it's not up the many other phones

There is no wireless charging
The phone too heavy when add backcase
Battery backup is excellent
Over all I would say not worthit
I guess iphones and galaxy's are still better way to go
